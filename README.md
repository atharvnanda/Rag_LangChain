# RAG with LangChain (From Scratch → Production)

This repository builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline step by step,
focusing on understanding LangChain internals instead of black-box usage.

## Current Progress

### Step 1: Document Loading
- Load multiple text files
- Convert raw data into LangChain `Document` objects
- Inspect metadata and content

No chunking, embeddings, or vector databases yet.

Each step is verified before moving forward.
