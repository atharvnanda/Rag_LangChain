Suryakumar Yadav is leading India in the T20 World Cup 2026. The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, the 10th edition of the tournament, is one of the most anticipated events in world cricket. Jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka under the International Cricket Council, the tournament is returning to the subcontinent, where big crowds, long evenings and intense pressure are becoming part of the everyday build-up. The competition is beginning on February 7, with three matches being played on the opening day, and is running until March 8. The final is being scheduled at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, although plans are also in place to shift the summit clash to Colombo if Pakistan are making the final, as per the agreement between the ICC, BCCI and PCB. With no host nation ever winning the T20 World Cup, that trend is once again hanging over the tournament. Check T20 World Cup Schedule here. Matches are being spread across eight venues in India and Sri Lanka, offering different conditions throughout the event. Games are being played at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi, Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and Eden Gardens in Kolkata, along with Sri Lankan venues such as the R Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, and Pallekele in Kandy. The semi-finals are being held on March 4 and 5, with venues rotating based on which teams qualify. The format is staying the same as the previous edition. Twenty teams are being divided into four groups of five, with the top two from each group moving into the Super Eight stage, which is starting on February 21 in Colombo. From there, the margins are getting thinner, with every match effectively carrying knockout pressure. India, the defending champions after their 2024 triumph, are opening their campaign on the first evening against the USA at the Wankhede Stadium. While the hosts are dealing with expectations and history, the focus of the tournament is remaining broader, with strong teams, varied conditions and high-stakes cricket ensuring the 2026 T20 World Cup unfolds as a true global contest rather than a home-centric story.

Only if 3 conditions met: Report Pakistan have held a high-level meeting with the ICC over their boycott of the India match in the T20 World Cup 2026. According to a report, the PCB has placed three conditions for any U-turn on its stance.AdvertisementPakistan to U-turn on India boycott? PCB places 3 demands to ICC. (Getty Images)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 9, 2026 14:10 ISTWritten By: Kingshuk KusariThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has placed three demands before the International Cricket Council (ICC) if it is to consult its government and explore the possibility of reversing its decision not to play its T20 World Cup match against India on February 15, according to Cricbuzz. Members of the PCB, along with Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chief Aminul Islam Bulbul, met an ICC delegation in Lahore on Sunday to explore an amicable solution, with a focus on ensuring that the India–Pakistan match goes ahead as scheduled.advertisementAmong other conditions, Pakistan has reportedly asked for a larger share of the revenue generated by the ICC.'Three Demands Made By Pakistan To The ICC'Increased share in ICC revenueRestoration of bilateral cricket with IndiaEnforcement of the handshake protocolThe controversy began when the Pakistan government publicly announced that it would not allow the team to play India at the T20 World Cup, despite the fixture being scheduled at a neutral venue. The Shehbaz Sharif-led government did not clearly spell out the reasons behind the boycott of their arch-rivals. The prevailing assumption in the cricketing world was that Pakistan’s stance was an act of solidarity with Bangladesh, who had pulled out of the tournament after the ICC rejected the BCB’s request to move their matches out of India over security concerns.The ICC subsequently attempted to negotiate with Pakistan and held a high-level meeting with PCB officials. ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta joined the discussions via Zoom, while PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, ICC Deputy Chairman Imran Khwaja, and Bangladesh Cricket Board president Aminul Islam Bulbul were present in Lahore.Cricbuzz further reported that Bangladesh may also seek compensation from the ICC, a settlement that Pakistan is expected to help broker as part of the ongoing negotiations.What's The Basis Of These 'Demands'?With the three reported demands, the Pakistan Cricket Board appears to be attempting to strong-arm the ICC. The PCB seemingly believes that the world body is at risk of missing out on a significant chunk of broadcasting revenue if the India–Pakistan match does not go ahead, and that this leverage could force the ICC into conceding to its demands.Pakistan are currently the fourth-highest earners from ICC revenue distributions. The PCB receives 5.75 per cent of the total revenue generated by the ICC. As per 2023 figures, Pakistan earn USD 34.51 million annually from the ICC, funds that are crucial to sustaining the country’s cricketing ecosystem. Only three boards earn more than the PCB: Cricket Australia (USD 128 million), the England and Wales Cricket Board (USD 139 million), and the BCCI (USD 293 million).advertisementThe second demand raised by the PCB is the restoration of bilateral cricket with India, according to Cricbuzz. It remains unclear why this demand has been placed before the ICC, as any decision on bilateral series lies squarely with the governments of the two countries. The ICC, at best, can only act as a mediator and does not have the authority to enforce bilateral engagements.The third and final demand is linked to the enforcement of a handshake protocol. It comes against the backdrop of India snubbing Pakistan during Asia Cup last year Following the Pahalgam terror attack, India took a firm stance by refusing to shake hands with Pakistani players and support staff, citing the broader context of cross-border terrorism and the prevailing national sentiment at the time.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Feb 9, 2026Also Read | Dhakshineswar Suresh's triple-haul gives India historic Davis Cup win vs NetherlandsMust Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchCongress Slams BJP Over Deleted Video Of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Taking AimConspiracy or medical negligence?

Zimbabwe bowlers are completely on top and will be hunting for quick wickets to keep the pressure high and bundle Oman out cheaply.

Richard Ngarava has the new ball in hand and is raring to go. A slip in place. Let's play...14:57 IST:It is now time for the national anthems. The on-field umpires make their way out in the middle.

It will be the national anthem of Oman first, followed by that of Zimbabwe.14:39 IST:Oman's skipper - Jatinder Singh says that they would have bowled as well, as it is a good track and batting will be better in the second innings. He adds that they arrived in Sri Lanka quite early and have had good preparation. Tells that it is quite humid here compared to Oman. He feels that a score of 150-160 is ideal on this surface and that anything above that will be a bonus.14:50 IST:The captain of Zimbabwe - Sikandar Raza says that they want to bowl first, as, looking at the wicket, there could be early movement. He adds that the pitch will get better later, so they want to give their seamers the best chance to bowl. He mentions that Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka share a good relationship, and they allowed them to come here early for preparation. On what will be a good score, Sikandar jokes that getting one more than the opposition will work. Shares that the idea is to bowl well and restrict Oman to a low score. He confirms that the bowling combination includes three seamers and two spinners.14:37 IST:Zimbabwe (Playing XI) - Brian Bennett, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Dion Myers, Brendan Taylor (WK), Sikandar Raza (C), Ryan Burl, Tashinga Musekiwa, Brad Evans, Wellington Masakadza, Richard Ngarava, Blessing Muzarabani.14:37 IST:Oman (Playing XI) - Jatinder Singh (C), Aamir Kaleem, Hammad Mirza, Wasim Ali, Karan Sonavale, Jiten Ramanandi, Vinayak Shukla (WK), Sufyan Mehmood, Nadeem Khan, Shah Faisal, Shakeel Ahmed.14:44 IST:TOSS - The coin lands in favour of Sikandar Raza and Zimbabwe elect to BOWL first.

Wayne Madsen's shoulder injury and Michael Leask's brilliance spoilt the Gli Azzuri debut.AdvertisementScotland spoilt what could have been a dream debut for Italy. (AP Photo)Debodinna ChakrabortyKolkata,UPDATED: Feb 9, 2026 14:39 ISTItaly’s first-ever T20 World Cup game was always going to feel special. New colours on the big stage, a fresh anthem in the air, and that debut-day buzz of “we’ve finally made it.” Eden Gardens in Kolkata was the perfect setting too, the kind of venue where even the toss feels like a moment.For Italy, history arrived the second Wayne Madsen walked out for the toss, and went on to even win it for his side.advertisementSCO vs ITA, T20 World Cup: Highlights | Scorecard However, what followed was a quick reminder that the World Cup can be an unforgiving place to learn.Italy’s debut ended in a 73-run defeat, bowled out for 134 in 16.4 overs while chasing Scotland’s 207. The evening also carried an added blow, with Madsen suffering a shoulder dislocation that could potentially rule him out for the rest of the tournament. Italy had their firsts, but Scotland made sure the scoreboard told the louder story.Italy had walked in with confidence. Madsen spoke at the toss about wanting a memorable campaign and backing their bowling strength. This wasn’t a side just happy to show up. The problem was Scotland didn’t arrive to play along. They arrived to take control, and they did it with calm sharpness.Even in defeat, Italy will take pride from four bowlers picking up their first World Cup wickets. Ben Manenti hitting a half-century.Those are the small milestones that matter. But the bigger picture was simple: Scotland were cleaner, stronger, and more ruthless in the key moments.How Scotland breached the 200-run markThere was a fun World Cup twist tucked inside Scotland’s dominance.In a tournament where most expected the 200-run mark to be crossed first by India, Pakistan, England or the West Indies, it was Scotland who got there before anyone else.George Munsey looked in scary touch, racing to 85 and playing like a man who had decided Eden Gardens was his personal playground. Italy did get a significant moment when Grant Stewart removed him, a wicket that will go down as one of Italy’s first major scalps at a World Cup. But Scotland didn’t slow down after that, because Michael Leask made sure the ending was loud. The final over went for 22 runs, and suddenly Italy weren’t chasing “a big total,” they were chasing a mountain.How Italy's 208 chase panned outItaly’s reply began with the kind of moment that makes you sigh, Justin Mosca gone first ball, a blunt welcome to World Cup cricket.advertisementBut almost immediately, Italy gave everyone a reminder that debutants can have bite too. Will Smuts struck Italy’s first-ever World Cup six, and then came an over that briefly lit up the evening. Smuts went 6,4,6 off the first three balls, and Mosca finished it with a towering six of his own, giving the crowd and the few Italy fans a moment to cheer for.Smuts was dismissed in the very next over, and from there Scotland’s control grew stronger. The fielding was sharp, the catching was clean, and the bowlers gave nothing away for free. Italy kept trying to find a way back in, but Scotland were already dictating the rhythm of the chase.Manenti brothers give Italy a highlight reelIf Italy fans needed one phase to hold on to from this debut, it was the Manenti brothers. Harry and Ben stitched together a blazing 73-run partnership for the fourth wicket, and for a while they made the chase feel interesting again. Harry played the aggressor, taking on the bowlers and finding boundaries, while Ben was the steady presence, rotating strike and picking gaps to make sure Italy didn’t lose shape completely.advertisementIt was one of those stands that makes you think Italy might be new here, but they are not out of place. They pushed Italy past 100 by the 12th over, and suddenly Scotland had to work again. But the breakthrough arrived in the 13th over, Harry was dismissed, and despite Ben having pushed on after his half-century, it was clear that the Manenti momentum had run its course.How Michael Leask ruined Italy's debutIf one name kept showing up at the wrong time for Italy, it was Michael Leask. He had already helped Scotland push beyond 200 with that brutal finish, and then he came back with the ball to rip through Italy’s chase, finishing with a superb 4/17.Ben Manenti still managed his own slice of history, becoming Italy’s first-ever World Cup half-centurion with a 29-ball fifty, but even that moment was brief as he was dismissed two balls later. Without Wayne Madsen able to take the crease because of his shoulder injury, Italy simply ran out of answers, and the innings folded at 134.Italy’s debut wasn’t perfect, far from it, but it wasn’t empty either. There were firsts, there were flashes, and there was the Manenti brothers’ stand that showed Italy can compete in patches. Scotland, though, were simply too polished for the Gli Azzuri.advertisementT20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Feb 9, 2026IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchCongress Slams BJP Over Deleted Video Of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Taking AimConspiracy or medical negligence?

Suryakumar, the leader While Gautam Gambhir has endured a difficult phase in Tests and a topsy-turvy run in ODIs, the head coach has enjoyed a sensational record in T20Is. Gambhir attributed the team's success in the shortest format to Suryakumar Yadav's leadership.AdvertisementSuryakumar Yadav and Gautam Gambhir (PTI Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 9, 2026 14:10 ISTWritten By: Akshay RameshHead coach Gautam Gambhir heaped rich praise on Suryakumar Yadav's ability to connect with players, saying the captain has made his life significantly easier as a coach in the shortest format of the game. Gambhir was speaking to the broadcasters during India's T20 World Cup campaign, highlighting the impact Suryakumar has had on the current group with his leadership skills."Surya has made my life a lot easier in this format," Gambhir, who has had the most success in T20Is as coach, told Star Sports.advertisementGambhir said Suryakumar's batting ability – his experience and trademark 360-degree range – has already been spoken about enough, but it is his calming influence in the dressing room that truly sets him apart. "I think he is a phenomenal leader of men – not by what he does on the field, not by the type of batter he is, not by the kind of shots that he plays. All that you can keep aside. But the way he relates to players, the way he talks to players, and how relaxed he is on the field," Gambhir said."As a coach, you know you can think about other things because he is going to keep the atmosphere pretty calm. Surya the player, I can keep aside, but Surya the leader has ticked every box. It's a great thing when you have someone like him leading the country because his heart is in the right place, and he takes the right decisions for the team."Clear communication. Calm leadership.Gautam Gambhir applauds SKY’s captaincy and how he connects with players to make a coach’s job easier.ICC Men's #T20WorldCup 2026 #INDvNAM | THU, FEB 12 | 6 PM pic.twitter.com/uXTaCokP04— Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) February 9, 2026SURYA SPECIAL IN MUMBAIGambhir's comments came a day after Suryakumar played one of his finest T20I knocks to help India survive a scare against the USA in their T20 World Cup opener in Mumbai on Saturday.India were in a spot of bother at 77 for 6 in the 13th over after the USA won the toss and opted to field. It appeared the Americans were on course to restrict India to a below-par total, but Suryakumar struck a brilliant 84 off 49 balls to lift the side to 161 for 9 in 20 overs.Suryakumar remained composed and found a way to score on a Wankhede Stadium surface that was unusually unsuited to free-flowing strokeplay, with the ball stopping and not coming on to the bat as nicely as expected.Using his range and famed 360-degree approach, he negotiated the bowling threat expertly, hitting 10 boundaries and four sixes.On the field, Suryakumar also marshalled his bowling resources impressively, backing his frontline bowlers to stay in the hunt for wickets rather than turning to part-time options. The USA were eventually restricted to 132 for 8 in their 20 overs as India survived a wobbly opening-day encounter.advertisementIndia will be looking to improve as they progress deeper into the tournament. The defending champions arrived at the World Cup as outright favourites, having demolished opponents in bilateral series with both bat and ball. Since taking over the captaincy from Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar has led India in 44 matches, winning 35 and losing just seven.The Indian squad, including captain Suryakumar, arrived in Delhi on Sunday ahead of their next Group A match against Namibia, scheduled for February 12. Coach Gambhir hosted the players for a special dinner at his residence in New Delhi, ensuring the team took a break from the rigours of training, travel and competition during the World Cup.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Feb 9, 2026Must Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchCongress Slams BJP Over Deleted Video Of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Taking AimConspiracy or medical negligence?

In our minds, it came down to the oldest rivalry in storytelling.On Sunday, England were defending 184 against Nepal in their opening T20 World Cup match. The Himalayan Kingdom needed six off the last ball. Sam Curran had the ball. Lokesh Bam had the bat. Karan KC was at the other hand.advertisementSam vs Bam. David vs Goliath. Wham Bam, Good night Sam? The Wankhede crowd held its breath, and a question. In 2024, David had defied expectations. Nepal had lost to South Africa by just one run. Will the underdog win today?The signs till the last over were promising. Jofra Archer, Luke Wood and Adil Rashid had been beaten out of shape by Nepal's batters. Just 10 were needed. But Curran's low yorkers held their shape.When the final delivery thudded into the fielder's hands at deep cover, the entire Wankhede could hear England exhale. England escaped by four runs, the scoreboard said defeat. But the stadium, the analysts, and the cricketing world knew better.Something had shifted.That over, those six balls, was the moment the T20 World Cup stopped being a tournament about favourites and became a story about disruption. Nepal won hearts in Mumbai on Sunday (AP Photo) THE DISRUPTIONThe first week of the T20 World Cup has shattered one of cricket's oldest assumptions: that there are minnows in international cricket. As Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus declared, it is high time the tags Associate and minnows were removed.In a tournament featuring 10 Associate nations, teams like Nepal, USA, and Netherlands have delivered performances that blur the line between established powers and emerging forces. All of them came within striking distance against England, India and Pakistan, losing only because of dropped catches, or defeat-defying brilliance of Curran and Suryakumar Yadav.ROM YAWN TO YARNWhen the tournament draw was announced, featuring 10 Associate nations, the collective response was a polite shrug. Group stages were supposed to be formalities, glorified net sessions for the big nations to tune up before the real tournament began.Analysts pencilled in predictable wins. Broadcasters scheduled their prime commentary teams for later rounds. Fans marked their calendars for the Super 8s, not the openers.Thank god they were all wrong.These so-called minnows have belied every fear of a dull start. Nepal vs England wasn't a warm-up, it was edge-of-seat theatre that had the Wankhede roaring like a knockout final.USA making India work for their victory wasn't a 300-run fest for Suryakumar Yadav and his batters. It was genuine competition, trial by fire. Netherlands challenging Pakistan turned what should have been a routine win into a doomsday scenario of elimination for fans in Karachi. India survived a scare against the USA in Mumbai on Saturday (AP Photo) The first few matches haven't just woken up the tournament; they've electrified it. The group stage has become must-watch cricket precisely because nothing is guaranteed.This tournament is reminding us why global competitions exist, and what happens when passion meets preparation, when underdogs get their moment, when the script gets thrown out and sport becomes genuinely surprising again.WHY FORMAT MATTERST20 is cricket's great democratiser. Twenty overs provide just enough time for individual brilliance to override systemic advantages. One explosive batter can score 70 off 35 balls and change the entire complexion of a chase. One inspired bowling spell can strangle even the deepest batting lineup.Traditional cricket formats allow class to eventually prevail. In Tests, depth of talent shows over five days. In ODIs, 50 overs smooth out variance. But T20 is pure volatility. Four bad overs, even when Archer is bowling them, can cost 60 runs, three dropped catches can swing the result, one batter's purple patch can overcome decades of infrastructure advantage.advertisementFranchise leagues have accelerated this democratisation. Players from Associate nations now regularly compete in the IPL, CPL, Big Bash, and other tournaments, facing elite bowlers and batters in high-pressure situations. These experiences translate directly to World Cups, closing the gap that once separated Associates from full members. When Nepal's batters hammered Archer, they weren't overawed, they'd seen pace like his in franchise cricket.THE FOOTBALL WORLD CUP PARALLELCricket is learning what football has long known: global tournaments breed upsets. Saudi Arabia stunning Argentina in 2022, South Korea eliminating Germany in 2018, Costa Rica's dream run in 2014, and Cameroon's Roger Milla magic in 1990 are parts of the sports loreIn football, these results happen because tournament pressure and one-off knockout formats reward preparation, passion, and perfect timing over consistent superiority.But T20 cricket might actually be more upset-prone than football. In football, a single goal is massive; teams can fall back and defend a 1-0 lead. In T20, teams score 150–180 runs, creating multiple inflection points. One batter's 70 can win a match, a brilliant over can turn the tide. The shorter format amplifies both brilliance and mistakes, making every match genuinely unpredictable.advertisementWHAT HAPPENS NEXTThe 2026 World Cup is expanding cricket's reach with performances that demand attention. The teams are delivering performances that threaten to reshape knockout stages and challenge fundamental assumptions about cricket's hierarchy.The question is no longer whether Associate nations can compete with full members in T20 cricket. Nepal, USA and the Netherlands have answered that definitively. The question now is: who will be the first Associate nation to actually win one of these tournaments?Based on Nepal's fearless batting, USA's growing infrastructure, and Netherlands' consistent excellence, that day may arrive sooner than cricket's establishment expects. When it does, we'll look back at Sam defending those final six balls against Bam as the moment the dam began to crack.And Davids became the new Goliaths.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Feb 9, 2026Must Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchCongress Slams BJP Over Deleted Video Of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Taking AimConspiracy or medical negligence?

The decision follows a key ICC meeting in Lahore as pressure mounts to resolve the tournament's biggest controversy.AdvertisementPakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi (Getty Images)India Today Sports DeskLahore,UPDATED: Feb 9, 2026 10:58 ISTWritten By: Debodinna ChakrabortyThe Pakistan Cricket Board is reportedly set to clarify its stance on the proposed boycott of its T20 World Cup 2026 match against India within the next 24 hours, following a marathon meeting with senior ICC officials in Lahore. With the mega India vs Pakistan, T20 World Cup group-stage match on February 15 just around the corner, the issue has quickly turned into one of the biggest talking points in world cricket.advertisementThe discussions took place at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium and stretched beyond five hours, involving PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, ICC Deputy Chairman Imran Khwaja, and Bangladesh Cricket Board president Aminul Islam. The urgency is obvious, with the ICC keen to avoid a situation where the tournament’s most high-profile fixture is left hanging in uncertainty.According to reports, the PCB is now expected to consult Pakistan’s federal government before taking a final call. Officials believe the next 24 hours could prove decisive, as the board weighs both political direction and the wider consequences of stepping away from cricket’s most watched rivalry. Naqvi is also likely to address a press conference today, with clarity expected soon after. What was the ICC-PCB meeting about?At the heart of the Lahore meeting was Pakistan’s decision to skip its scheduled group match against India on February 15 in Colombo. The boycott announcement, made on February 2 with the World Cup less than a week away, escalated tensions and forced the ICC into urgent negotiations.Bangladesh’s presence in the talks added another layer. BCB President, Aminul Islam, had landed in Lahore just hours before the meeting, signalling that Bangladesh and Pakistan have found common ground as the ICC works to broker a compromise. Sources told India Today that both boards have aligned their positions during these discussions.The ICC’s primary focus has been to prevent the situation from spiralling into a full-blown crisis, one that could impact scheduling, governance, and the commercial structure of the tournament.Naqvi, meanwhile, is set to brief Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the matters discussed, underlining just how significant the decision has become beyond cricket alone.Why does ICC want an IND vs PAK match at T20 World Cup?Simply put, no fixture in cricket comes close to India vs Pakistan in terms of global attention and financial value. It is the sport’s biggest revenue driver, powering broadcast rights, sponsorship deals, advertising interest, and worldwide viewership.Broadcasters pay a premium largely because marquee games like this are guaranteed audience magnets. If Pakistan were to withdraw, the ICC’s broadcast package would immediately lose value, creating a knock-on effect across the tournament’s finances.The effect will stretch out in problematic extent, as reduced revenues would eventually affect annual payouts to member boards, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and even India.advertisementWith the clock ticking and the World Cup already underway, the next 24 hours could shape whether cricket’s fiercest rivalry takes centre stage or becomes the biggest absentee of the tournament.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Feb 9, 2026Also Read | Matchday Preview: Italy set for World Cup debut as SA, Zimbabwe begin campaignsMust Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchCongress Slams BJP Over Deleted Video Of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Taking AimConspiracy or medical negligence?

The visit comes right ahead of ICC crucial meeting with Pakistan over their boycott of match against India.AdvertisementBCB president flies to Lahore to meet PCB head Mohsin Naqvi. (BCB Photo)Nitin Kumar SrivastavaNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 8, 2026 14:42 ISTHours before the International Cricket Council’s meeting with Pakistan over the team’s boycott of their T20 World Cup match against India, Bangladesh Cricket Board president Aminul Islam Bulbul has landed in Lahore. Sources told India Today that Pakistan and Bangladesh have tied hands as the ICC attempts to negotiate an amicable solution with Mohsin Naqvi’s PCB in a bid to convince Pakistan to overturn their boycott of the most lucrative fixture of the ICC T20 World Cup.advertisementThe ICC meeting, expected to be held over Zoom on Sunday, February 8 evening, will involve ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta along with Naqvi and Bulbul, as the sport’s governing body scrambles to contain a crisis that now threatens the integrity of the tournament schedule.India Today has learnt that the PCB are trying to broker a deal in which Bangladesh are also part of the negotiation table, despite not travelling to India for the T20 World Cup 2026. Earlier, on February 2, with the World Cup less than a week away, Pakistan announced that they would not play India on February 15 in Colombo, escalating a controversy that began with Bangladesh refusing to travel to India for the tournament, citing security concerns.Bangladesh, backed by its interim government, had formally requested the ICC to move its fixtures to Sri Lanka, the tournament’s co-host. The ICC rejected the request and replaced Bangladesh with Scotland, triggering a chain reaction.Why is ICC Holding Meeting With PCB?An India vs Pakistan cricket match remains one of the biggest revenue drivers in world sport. From broadcast deals to sponsorships and advertising, no other fixture in cricket comes close in terms of commercial value. It is therefore unsurprising that the ICC is pushing the PCB to reconsider its stance before the situation spirals further.If Pakistan were to skip the match against India, the ICC’s broadcasting revenue would take a significant hit. Broadcasters pay a premium largely because of marquee fixtures like India vs Pakistan, and the absence of that game would immediately devalue the tournament’s commercial package.The ripple effect would be unavoidable. Any loss in broadcast revenue would ultimately reflect on the ICC’s annual disbursement to its member boards, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and even India. That is a scenario the ICC is keen to avoid.From the world body’s perspective, the meeting is about damage control. The ICC appears determined to step in before the issue escalates to a point where financial losses, legal complications and questions over governance consistency become unavoidable. Simply put, the ICC does not want the situation to drift beyond repair.What is perhaps most intriguing is the presence of the Bangladesh Cricket Board in the discussions. Bangladesh have already been removed from the tournament and, on paper, will not receive any share of the broadcasting revenues generated from the T20 World Cup.advertisementHowever, the stakes for Bangladesh cricket are far bigger than this one event. If the India vs Pakistan fixture is cancelled and the ICC’s overall broadcast revenues take a hit, the financial impact will be felt across the board. Reduced ICC earnings inevitably mean smaller annual distributions to member nations in the long run, and Bangladesh would be among those affected.Bangladesh Thanks Pakistan for World Cup StanceBangladesh made it clear that they were aligned with Pakistan in their position against India after Bangladesh’s Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul publicly thanked Islamabad for backing Dhaka’s stance.“Thank you, Pakistan,” Nazrul wrote on Facebook. “Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said that his country has decided to boycott the match against India in protest of Bangladesh being excluded from the T20 World Cup.”Nazrul serves as the sports adviser in Bangladesh’s unelected interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, which was installed after Sheikh Hasina’s government was ousted during the July–August 2024 agitation. In effect, Nazrul functions as the country’s sports minister.The Pakistan Cricket Board, meanwhile, has been instructed by the Sharif government to skip the India fixture after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament for refusing to play on Indian soil.advertisement“We have taken a very clear stand on the T20 World Cup that we won't play the match against India because there should be no politics on the sports field,” Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said at a government meeting in Islamabad.With the ICC now forced into crisis talks involving all stakeholders, Bulbul’s presence in Lahore underscores how deeply the issue has moved beyond cricket — and how difficult it may be for the world body to enforce consistency without inflaming an already volatile situation.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Feb 8, 2026Also Read | As T20 World Cup begins, Gen Z need to realise journalists are not cheerleadersMust Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchVideo: Terrifying moment when 'tsunami' swing snaps mid-air, crashes to groundUS trade deal shows India’s confidence, not compromise: Piyush GoyalTime doesn't heal anything, it gives you strength to carry weight: Usha UthupAdvertisementRead ThisBengaluru woman says she borrows Rs 30,000 a month amid unemploymentNew Zealand pass Afghanistan spin test in Chennai to lay down early markerFace of fascism: Opposition trains guns at BJP over Himanta's 'point-blank' videoTRENDING TOPICST20 World CupT20 World Cup ScheduleT20 World Cup Points TableAdvertisement

(Image: AP, Reuters)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 8, 2026 22:34 ISTWritten By: Amar Sunil PanickerBetter late than never? Donald Trump has sent a rousing good luck message to the USA cricket team—unfortunately, it arrived a full 24 hours after they'd already been defeated by India in the T20 World Cup.The US President took to Truth Social on Sunday evening to share his support for Team USA, posting: "I just heard the Cricket World Cup is underway in India! I wish the best of luck to TEAM USA! We have a very strong team. America is rooting for you!" Image: Screengrab (Donald Trump/Truth Social) advertisementThe message, posted at 9:12 pm on February 8, came a day after India had already handed the Americans a comprehensive 29-run defeat at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium on Saturday night. Trump's post, accompanied by a photo of the USA squad, has garnered nearly 3,000 likes and over 600 retweets, with many cricket fans pointing out the amusing timing of the presidential pep talk. India Dominate Despite Early ScareSaturday's match at the Wankhede saw defending champions India survive a stunning top-order collapse to secure victory. Captain Suryakumar Yadav played a lone hand with an unbeaten 84 off 49 balls, rescuing India from a precarious 77 for six. His innings featured 10 fours and four sixes as he almost single-handedly dragged India to 161 for nine.South Africa-born Shadley van Schalkwyk was the star with the ball for the USA, claiming four wickets for just 25 runs. India's celebrated batting lineup crumbled against disciplined American bowling, with Abhishek Sharma falling for a first-ball duck and several others failing to make significant contributions.USA's Spirited Fight Falls ShortChasing 162, USA were blown away early by Mohammed Siraj, who joined the Indian squad late on Friday as a replacement for an indisposed Jasprit Bumrah. Siraj bowled with Test match precision, taking three wickets for 29 runs, including both openers. USA slumped to 13 for three in the fourth over and never recovered.Milind Kumar (34), Sanjay Krishnamurthi (37), and Shubham Ranjane (37) fought valiantly to reduce the margin of defeat, but India's spinners Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel strangled the middle overs, conceding just 48 runs while taking three wickets between them.USA eventually finished at 132 for eight, falling 29 runs short. While Trump's late encouragement might not have changed the result, Team USA can take pride in pushing the defending champions harder than most expected—even if the presidential well-wishes arrived after the final ball had been bowled.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Amar PanickerPublished On: Feb 8, 2026Read More: | How Siraj cancelled plans to watch Real Madrid after shock T20 World Cup call-upIN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchVideo: Terrifying moment when 'tsunami' swing snaps mid-air, crashes to groundUS trade deal shows India’s confidence, not compromise: Piyush GoyalTime doesn't heal anything, it gives you strength to carry weight: Usha UthupAdvertisementRead ThisDirectors Guild Awards 2026: One Battle After Another director wins bigIran jails Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi for 7 years after hunger strikeDonald Trump's good luck message to USA cricket team 24 hours after loss to IndiaTRENDING TOPICST20 World CupT20 World Cup ScheduleT20 World Cup Points TableAdvertisement

Courtesy: Getty/APIndia Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 8, 2026 21:01 ISTWritten By: Sabyasachi ChowdhuryNepal bowler Nandan Yadav was overwhelmed after South African legend Dale Steyn offered to coach Nepal. On Sunday, February 8, Steyn praised Nepal for their spirited performance in the T20 World Cup clash against England at the iconic Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, a match full of twists and drama.Chasing 185, Nepal fought until the very last ball, needing six runs, but England held their nerve to win by four runs. Impressed by Nepal’s fearless display against the 2022 champions, Steyn took to social media to offer his guidance and support to the emerging cricketing nation.advertisementSteyn wrote, “Nepal, I offer my services to you if you ever need em! Up, up and UP!” Nandan said it was a huge moment for Nepal cricket that a player of Steyn’s calibre offered to help. “So that’s a big thing for us. A legend who ruled cricket for 10 years is tweeting about us,” Yadav said in the post-match press conference.Nandan, however, said it would be up to the team management to decide whether Steyn coaches Nepal in the future. “But it’s up to the management team, so we can’t approach him directly. Maybe we could, I’m not sure how to answer that one,” Yadav added.HOW DID NANDAN, NEPAL PERFORM VS ENGLAND?Nandan had an impressive day in the office after he finished with figures of 3-0-25-2. He first got the batter of Jos Buttler after which he dismissed Harry Brook. On the back of his spell, Nepal pulled England back and only let them score 184 for seven when the Brits were expected to score above 200.Chasing 184, Nepal got a flying start through Kushal Bhurtel, and a resilient partnership between Rahul Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee kept them in the hunt. Their bowlers, including Airee and Nandan Yadav, constantly threatened England with key wickets.With 10 runs needed off the final over, Nepal dared to dream of a historic win, and the Wankhede Stadium roared with belief. But Sam Curran held his nerve, and England survived a thrilling contest, breaking Nepali hearts in a dramatic T20 World Cup clash.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Feb 8, 2026Also Read | Bangladesh, Pakistan bhai bhai: BCB head meets Mohsin Naqvi ahead of crucial ICC meetingMust Watch Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchVideo: Terrifying moment when 'tsunami' swing snaps mid-air, crashes to groundUS trade deal shows India’s confidence, not compromise: Piyush GoyalTime doesn't heal anything, it gives you strength to carry weight: Usha UthupAdvertisementRead ThisDale Steyn’s special message leaves Nepal bowler emotional after heroic fight vs EnglandKennedy trailer: Rahul Bhat turns lethal in Anurag Kashyap’s noir worldAAP’s Saurabh Bhardwaj detained during candle march over Delhi biker’s deathTRENDING TOPICST20 World CupT20 World Cup ScheduleT20 World Cup Points TableAdvertisement

AdvertisementT20 World Cup: Sri Lanka beat Ireland by 20 runs in Colombo (AP Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 8, 2026 23:23 ISTSri Lankan spinners stamped their authority over Ireland in their opening fixture of the T20 World Cup 2026 on Sunday, February 8, guiding the hosts to a 20-run victory at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Wanindu Hasaranga (3/25) and Maheesh Theekshana (3/23) made full use of the favourable conditions to help Sri Lanka begin their campaign with an emphatic win.advertisementChasing a target of 164, Ireland were firmly in control of the pursuit, with Harry Tector (40 off 34) and Lorcan Tucker (21 off 18) adding 49 runs for the third wicket off just 38 deliveries. The Irish required 60 runs from the final six overs and backed themselves to complete the chase, with two well-set batters at the crease.However, Dunith Wellalage broke the momentum by dismissing Tucker, who was caught at long-on. Tector followed in the very next over, holing out to deep mid-wicket against Hasaranga, leaving Ireland in deep trouble. There was no recovery thereafter, as Hasaranga and Theekshana spun a web around the batters, skittling Ireland for 143 in 19.4 overs. The duo varied their pace remarkably, beating Ireland batters in flight, who found it tough to decipher their variations. Hasaranga and Theekshana's remarkable show has put the rest of the teams on notice as the Lankan lions will use their strength to the full in home conditions, promising a victory run in the campaign ahead.A quick change of pace and Maheesh Theekshana gets the better of Paul Striling!

Just as Mishara looked set to accelerate, he holed out to mid-off against Mark Adair.Following the early loss, Nissanka continued to build his innings alongside Kusal Mendis, with the pair putting on 34 runs for the second wicket from 26 balls. However, the opener struggled to shift gears and found it difficult to score freely against the spinners. His scratchy knock eventually came to an end when he hit straight to Paul Stirling off George Dockrell (2/17).Mendis duo rescue Sri LankaThe left-arm spinner struck again in his very next over as Pavan Rathnayake (5 off 9) suffered a moment of poor judgement, attempting to ramp Dockrell only to have his stumps disturbed. Gareth Delany (1/24) provided excellent support from the other end, choking the Sri Lankan batters through the middle overs.advertisementDelany later removed Dunith Wellalage (10 off 13), sending him back to the pavilion and leaving the hosts reeling at 86/4 in 13.5 overs. The Sri Lankan batters had few answers to Ireland’s spin duo, who employed flight and guile to bamboozle the hosts and give them a taste of their own medicine.Dispatched for an 85m six!Kamindu Mendis’ valuable cameo of 44(19) shifted the momentum for SL in the death overs!ICC Men’s #T20WorldCup | #SLvIRE | LIVE NOW https://t.co/AaKfib9jeV pic.twitter.com/8oMEftAMtH— Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) February 8, 2026It ultimately required a herculean effort from the Mendis duo — Kusal (56* off 43) and Kamindu (44 off 19) — who combined to stitch together a crucial 67-run partnership from just 29 balls for the fifth wicket, propelling Sri Lanka’s total beyond the 160-run mark.Courtesy of that counter-attacking stand, Sri Lanka posted a competitive 163/6 in their allotted 20 overs.

The BCB said there was nothing more they could do.AdvertisementBangladesh cricket now faces a dark period of uncertainty. (Image: AP)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Jan 25, 2026 09:37 ISTWritten By: Debodinna ChakrabortyThe Bangladesh Cricket Board have officially accepted the International Cricket Council’s decision to remove Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup 2026, admitting there is little more they can do at this stage. The response comes after the ICC confirmed that Scotland will replace Bangladesh in the tournament scheduled to be held in India and Sri Lanka next month.Addressing the fallout on Saturday, the BCB said it respected the ICC Board’s final ruling, even though its own requests were not met. With the ICC refusing to relocate Bangladesh’s matches or alter group allocations, the board was left with no alternative but to accept the decision. BCB media committee chairman Amjad Hossain said the board had exhausted all possible options before reaching this point.advertisement“We have tried our best. We fully respect the ICC Board, and the Board’s majority decision was that the match cannot be relocated... Even after that, we tried in our own way and made requests. Since they will not do it or do not want to, there is nothing more we can do," Hossain said. Bangladesh had consistently maintained that it was unsafe for the team to travel to India, a position backed by government advice. However, Hossain confirmed that Bangladesh have accepted the ICC’s verdict in full and will not pursue any further appeal or arbitration.“We have accepted the ICC Board’s decision, as the ICC has said that we will not be able to go and play, nor can our match be shifted to Sri Lanka...In this case, we cannot go to India to play, and our stance remains the same. We are not going into any separate arbitration or any other process here," he said.“We have spoken with the government. The government has said that going to India to play in the World Cup would not be safe for us, for our players, journalists, or anyone accompanying the team,” Hossain added.Why Bangladesh pulled out of T20 World CupBangladesh’s withdrawal was formally acknowledged after the ICC informed the BCB via a letter following a key meeting in Dubai, convened by ICC chairman Jay Shah. In a final effort to delay the outcome, the BCB requested that the matter be referred to the ICC’s dispute resolution committee. However, the committee ruled that it could not function as an appeal forum, allowing the ICC’s decision to proceed.The BCB had proposed two alternatives:Relocating Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka.Shifting the team from Group C to another group.However, both requests were rejected. The ICC Board had earlier agreed that if Bangladesh failed to secure government clearance to travel to India, the team would be replaced in the tournament.Underlying tensions are believed to have escalated after the Board of Control for Cricket in India reportedly requested Kolkata Knight Riders to drop Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad. While no official link was established, the episode was widely viewed as a trigger that hardened Bangladesh’s stance amid strained diplomatic relations.Despite an independent ICC security assessment concluding there was no specific threat to teams in India, the BCB remained firm, citing concerns for players, officials, media personnel and supporters. With no compromise reached, the ICC moved ahead with Scotland as Bangladesh’s replacement, bringing an end to a prolonged stand-off that has left the BCB facing renewed scrutiny at home.- EndsPublished By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 25, 2026Also Read | Scotland reacts to surprise T20 World Cup opportunity, confirm immediate travel plansMust Watch Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchYou’ll get tired beta: PM’s warm moment with child holding his pic at Kerala rallyUdhampur police rescue 12 people stranded in heavy snowfall in J&K's BasantgarhWatch: Ajith's fans burst crackers for Mankantha intro scene inside auditoriumAdvertisementRead ThisIPL 2026: CSK suffer big blow as Rs 14.2 crore recruit left seriously injuredProfessor stabbed to death by passenger in Mumbai local train after argumentI am losing body fat, but my weight is not changing.

However, a Sports Ministry source confirmed that Indian men's cricket team will not be stopped from playing against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, starting September 9. AdvertisementIndian cricket team will not be stopped from playing in Asia Cup, says Sports Ministry source (AP Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Aug 22, 2025 08:35 ISTIndia and Pakistan will not participate in any bilateral sporting events, but the Indian cricket team will be allowed to compete in the upcoming multi-nation Asia Cup, a source in the Sports Ministry confirmed on Thursday.The Indian government has upheld a consistent policy of not engaging in bilateral sporting events with Pakistan. The Sports Ministry, on August 21, said Indian teams will not travel to Pakistan, nor will they host Pakistani teams in any bilateral series.advertisementHowever, this restriction does not extend to multilateral tournaments, such as the World Cups and the Olympics, where both countries participate under the jurisdiction of international governing bodies. These tournaments are held in neutral or third-party venues, ensuring no direct bilateral arrangements and maintaining a politically neutral environment for competition. A source in the ministry confirmed to India Today that India will not be barred from playing against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, which is organised by the Asian Cricket Council. The Asia Cup will feature high-profile India-Pakistan matches scheduled for 14 and possibly 21 September in Dubai, with the final on 29 September. The tournament will follow the T20 International format ahead of next year's T20 World Cup.India and Pakistan have not engaged in bilateral cricket since the 2012–13 season. Since then, the men’s and women’s teams of both countries have only faced each other in multi-nation tournaments and multi-sport events.India had refused to travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in 2023 and the Champions Trophy in 2025, citing security concerns. These tournaments were then held in neutral venues. More recently, Pakistan’s hockey team declined to travel to India for the Asia Cup Hockey, scheduled to begin on 28 September in Rajgir.Several voices, including those of former cricketers, have urged the Indian men’s cricket team to boycott their Asia Cup match against Pakistan. These calls came in the wake of heightened tensions between the two nations following the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, most of them tourists. In its aftermath, India launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle terror infrastructure across the border.INDIA'S NEW POLICYIndia's approach to sports events involving Pakistan reflects its overall policy in dealing with that country. Regarding bilateral sports events held in each other's countries, Indian teams will not participate in competitions in Pakistan, nor will Pakistani teams be permitted to play in India."With regard to international and multilateral events, in India or abroad, we are guided by the practices of international sports bodies and the interest of our own sportspersons. It is also relevant to take into account India's emergence as a credible venue to host international sports events," the Sports Ministry said.advertisementAccordingly, Indian teams and individual players will take part in international events that also have teams or players from Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistani players and teams will be able to participate in such multilateral events hosted by India," it added.VISA PROCESS TO BE SIMPLIFIEDThe policy also highlights India's emergence as a credible venue for international sports and commits to simplifying visa procedures for sportspersons, team officials, technical personnel, and office-bearers of international sports governing bodies."To position India as a preferred destination for hosting international sporting events, the visa process for sportspersons, team officials, technical personnel, and office-bearers of International Sports Governing Bodies shall be simplified.

The question remains: at what cost?Live TVShareAdvertisementDid theatrics take over cricket in India vs Pakistan. (Reuters Photo)Sandipan SharmaNew Delhi,UPDATED: Sep 15, 2025 18:04 ISTThe Indian team’s refusal to shake hands with Pakistan’s players after the Asia Cup clash wasn’t principle - it was petty posturing. The snub felt like a cheap gesture that traded cricket’s essence for optics. It projected outrage but eroded dignity.India had a choice - to take a stand outside the field, to put courtesy above spectacle, grace over petulance. By not making the right choice, India diminished both sport and statement alike.advertisementHad the BCCI chosen to boycott Pakistan outright, the world might have read it as clarity of conscience. Choosing instead to weaponise a handshake left the message muddled, the players burdened, and the game itself diminished. India's Suryakumar Yadav does not shake hands with Salman Agha in Asia Cup. (Reuters Photo) Right Intent, Wrong ActThe context is undeniable. India was still reeling from the Pahalgam terror attack, and the country wanted symbolic solidarity.But if the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) truly wanted to take a stand, the moment for that was earlier - by boycotting Pakistan’s participation or refusing to play.Having chosen to contest the fixture, the players’ role should have been simple: perform competitively, then extend the courtesy that defines sport. The handshake embodies that principle.By staging the protest through players, the BCCI blurred lines that should have remained distinct. It placed cricketers in a position they were never meant to occupy - forced to embody the politics of the state. A coherent stance would have been for administrators to decide, not athletes to dramatise. What resulted instead was a muddled gesture, neither firm policy nor genuine solidarity, and in its wake, the spirit of the game endured unnecessary damage.Worse, this was no impulsive act of emotion. Reports make clear it was premeditated and carefully choreographed. At the toss, both captains skipped the usual pre-match handshake - a directive reportedly relayed by the match referee to Pakistan in advance.After a commanding seven-wicket win, instead of crossing the pitch to share the customary handshake, the Indian players quickly retreated, shutting the dressing room doors in the faces of puzzled and disappointed Pakistani players, who had waited to extend their greetings. Pakistan's captain Salman Ali Agha responded with a silent protest, boycotting the post-match presentation.Later, Pakistan’s management formally lodged complaints with the match referee, ACC, and ICC, calling the snub unsportsmanlike and against cricket’s spirit.advertisementACC chief Mohsin Naqvi publicly criticised India for “dragging politics into the game,” warning that sport should stand above such divides.Indian captain Surya Kumar Yadav, thrown in the middle of a slugfest, bravely argued, “Some things are ahead of sportsman spirit. We stand with all victims and dedicate this win to our brave armed forces.”Just Not CricketWhile the motive behind the gesture is understandable, the refusal to shake hands came at the cost of mutual respect earned through hours of competition and camaraderie.Sport is an arena where respect, politeness, and shared humanity should flourish despite external divides. When players who have faced each other as opponents, teammates, and colleagues forsake these basic courtesies, the greater cause suffers. Cricket’s universal appeal lies in its ability to transcend politics, reminding us that beyond flags and headlines, it is a game played between people.Honouring grief through sporting snubs does not elevate a cause; it diminishes the very essence of sportsmanship that cricket proudly upholds.The backlash from fans and critics raises uncomfortable questions. Is it ethical for sporting teams to snub their opponents as a proxy for political protest? Or does that erode the very “spirit of sport” cricket claims to uphold? What does it mean when sport, intended to unite in competition, becomes another tool of separation? How far can politics invade sports? These are questions administrators must answer, not athletes. For if cricketers themselves are reduced to symbols of statecraft, the very essence of sport will be lost.advertisementAt the post-match conference, Surya Kumar Yadav bravely answered questions, parrying the controversy by saying he has kept all external noise out.Ironically, by refusing to shake hands, India forced global cricket—and its own fans—to confront the inextricable link between sport and politics. It ended up politicising what was just an ordinary game of cricket.Theatrics and OpticsThe Asia Cup, intended as a festival of cricketing prowess, has become a stage for diplomatic drama, with Pakistan getting the opportunity to claim victimhood, even after a routine drubbing on the field.The match, a no-contest snoozefest, will be forgotten within days. But, the handshake that never happened will linger longer in memory than the runs or wickets, reminding both nations that, sometimes, what isn’t done speaks loudest of all.The match will become a footnote in another chapter of India-Pakistan rivalry. What will survive is the moment when cricket was asked to bear a burden too heavy, and collapsed under the weight.- EndsPublished By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Sep 15, 2025Tune InAlso Read | Beyond the scorecard: How Suryakumar Yadav's handshake snub stung PakistanMust Watch Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchCongress Slams BJP Over Deleted Video Of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Taking AimConspiracy or medical negligence?

BCB chief Aminul Islam Bulbul reached Pakistan to be at the meeting between the ICC and the Pakistan Cricket Board. Here we analyse why Bulbul took the midnight flight to Lahore.AdvertisementIn Lahore, Aminul Islam Bulbul was received by Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Salman Nasir. (Social Media Image)India Today News DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 9, 2026 16:33 ISTWritten By: Sushim MukulAt 1.00 am, early on Sunday (February 8), Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam Bulbul was waiting to board a flight at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. While some members of the BCB were likely asleep by then, others would have had no clue about Bulbul's itinerary. They came to know of the midnight mission only after a text message landed on the BCB directors' WhatsApp group, informing them that Aminul Islam Bulbul was heading to Lahore.advertisement"This trip was confirmed just 90 minutes ago. I am now at the airport. Due to the short notice, I could not call anyone. The meeting will be held (on February 8) at 4 pm Lahore time. I will return on the evening of February 9," Aminul Islam Bulbul wrote in the message, according to Bangladeshi newspaper Prothom Alo.Even as the message confirmed that Aminul Islam Bulbul was travelling to Lahore, it left BCB directors guessing about the purpose and agenda of the visit. "I know exactly what you know. The BCB president has gone to Lahore. I will know the rest after he contacts us following the meeting like the BCB," a board member told the newspaper, seeking anonymity. Aminul Islam Bulbul's midnight dash to Lahore was very much a part of the crisis around the ICC T20 World Cup 2026. While Bangladesh had dropped out already, Pakistan initially said it wouldn't play against India in Colombo, in solidarity with Dhaka.The Lahore meeting, amid reports of Pakistan's possible U-turn on its India boycott, acquired significance. So, Bulbul's physical presence at the ICC-Pakistan meeting, where the global cricketing body reportedly sought the PCB's reconsideration of its decision to not play India, raised eyebrows. Was Bulbul present there to support Pakistan, which earlier backed Dhaka and was now contemplating a potential U-turn? Was it a bargaining signal? Who was bargaining and for what?On the other hand, while the meeting also had participants joining over Zoom, why did the BCB chief feel compelled to be present in person in Lahore? The meeting's agenda was largely centred on Pakistan's case, not Bangladesh's, as Scotland had already joined the T20 World Cup as its replacement.T20 WORLD CUP: PAK SUPPORTED DHAKA, NOW RECONSIDERING INDIA MATCHPakistani media reported that BCB's Aminul Islam Bulbul arrived in Lahore on Sunday, where he was received by his PCB chief executive, Salman Nasir. The PCB posted a video welcoming him, quoting Nasir as saying, "We warmly welcome the honourable guest on arrival in Pakistan".The PCB had announced it would not play against India in their February 15 T20 World Cup group match in Colombo after Bangladesh refused to travel to India for the tournament citing security concerns. Backed by the interim regime of Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh requested the ICC to shift its fixtures from India to Sri Lanka. The ICC rejected the request and replaced Bangladesh with Scotland. This triggered a chain reaction.advertisementThen on Friday, Bangladesh's sports adviser Asif Nazrul thanked Pakistan for backing Dhaka's boycott of the T20 World Cup match. A day earlier, Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif publicly justified the move as standing "completely" with Bangladesh. This exposed how both governments made cricket a theatre of a political engagement against India.Now, since Pakistan pulled out of the lucrative fixture against India, the ICC reportedly moved to hold talks for them to reconsider. It was in that pursuit that the ICC meeting, involving CEO Sanjog Gupta and Naqvi, was called on. And the BCB's Aminul Islam Bulbul was present in person, even as Gupta joined the meeting over Zoom.WHAT HAPPENED IN 5-HOUR-LONG LAHORE MEETING OF ICC, PCB, BCBThe marathon five-hour meeting at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium ended without an immediate resolution. Pakistan is now expected to consult its PM Shehbaz Sharif-led federal government before taking a final call on whether it would play India on February 15. Bangladesh, anyway, is out now.advertisementPakistan informed the ICC that any reconsideration of its boycott would depend on three conditions. It sought a larger share of ICC revenue, restoration of bilateral cricket with India, and enforcement of a handshake protocol.The handshake issue has its genesis in an Asia Cup match when the India players refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts.The Pakistani board also said that the final call on playing against India in the T20 World Cup would be taken only after consulting its federal government headed by PM Sharif, in which the PCB's chief, Naqvi, is the Interior Minister. Bulbul and Naqvi also reportedly had a one-on-one meeting in Lahore.The Bangladeshi Cricket Board, like other Bangladeshi departments, has been aligning itself with Pakistan's organs. The ICC meeting was more to do with safeguarding the cricket council's revenues if Pakistan did not play with India. The loss would eventually affect annual payouts to all member boards, including Bangladesh.Bangladesh reportedly used the Lahore talks to push for compensation or a settlement following its removal from the T20 World Cup.SO, WHY WAS BANGLADESH PRESENT AT THE ICC-PCB MEETING?Bangladesh's presence at the Lahore meeting was of significance despite its removal from the tournament. Pakistan is now weighing a possible U-turn after Bangladesh had already dropped out. For Bangladesh, which has no realistic pathway back into the World Cup, Aminul Islam Bulbul's presence must have been for a reason.advertisementBy attending in person, the BCB stayed consistent with its position over the past few months, which is openly siding with Pakistan. The move also strengthened Islamabad's stance and its negotiating hand with the ICC.The India versus Pakistan match is the biggest revenue generator in world cricket. The ICC earns hundreds of millions from broadcast rights, sponsorships, and advertising. Smaller boards like Bangladesh receive a fraction of ICC revenue, but these funds, often in the millions, are crucial for running domestic cricket, paying players, and developing infrastructure. The ICC's revenue distribution helps such boards function and sustain their cricketing ecosystem, even if they do not play in marquee fixtures.The BCB chief's presence in the meeting could also have been used by the ICC to make Pakistan reconsider its decision of not playing India, according to Bangladeshi sports analyst and journalist Deb Chowdhury."It is through Bangladesh that the ICC is trying to get Pakistan to agree... If the India-Pakistan match does not take place, the financial loss will be significant. But if the match goes ahead, Bangladesh could still receive the share it was meant to get, minimising the impact of its removal from the World Cup," Chowdhury said on his YouTube channel.advertisement"If Bangladesh is assured that its absence from the World Cup will not hurt its finances or future events, it could be ready to influence Pakistan to play India, making it a win-win for all," he added.So, Aminul Islam Bulbul's 1-am dash to Lahore might have seemed sudden and unexplained to his own board, but it certainly highlighted how deeply Bangladesh was involved or is forced to be involved in the cricketing affairs of Pakistan. What is also revealed is that sports doesn't remain untouched by international politics.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Sushim MukulPublished On: Feb 9, 2026Tune InMust Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchSharad Pawar hospitalised following throat infection and feverCongress Slams BJP Over Deleted Video Of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Taking AimConspiracy or medical negligence?

They lost their last five wickets for just five runs. Scotland clinch a 73-run win, days after their defeat to the West Indies. Italy showed promise, but it was not enough for them on their World Cup debut. Sctoland cricket team Hi and welcome to India Today's highlights of the T20 World Cup 2026. Italy and Scotland are playing each other in their Group B fixture of the tournament. The match is being hosted by the iconic Eden Gardens in Kolkata. 14:32 IST:One down, two to go - A fascinating start to the new week in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup and it is Scotland who get their first points on the board. Next up, there is a Group B clash between Zimbabwe and Oman lined up in Colombo. The toss is just about to happen in that game, and you can simply switch tabs and tune in to our coverage. Cheers!14:30 IST:Richie Berrington, the captain of Scotland - Richie Berrington says it was really important to bounce back after the loss against West Indies. It was a comprehensive performance. On George Munsey, Richie says he is an important player as he sets the tempo for them and today's partnership with Michael Jones helped to set the platform for a big score. On his bowling performance, Berrington is happy to see guys put in a great shift. Tells that early wickets in the Powerplay were key, but Italy bounced back with a couple of partnerships. Feels that they have got to know about the conditions here but are looking forward to the match against England. Reckons that the boys have embraced the chance to play the World Cup.14:29 IST:Harry Manenti, the stand-in captain for Italy - Harry starts by giving an update on the captain, Wayne Madsen and says that he has dislocated his left shoulder, which is not a good sign for them. Mentions that at the innings break, they thought it was a par score and if they batted well in the Powerplay, they could chase it down. Feels that you need to go hard at times when you are chasing in excess of 200 runs, and sometimes it doesn't come off. Adds that it was special batting with his brother out on the big stage and mentions that it is a dream come true for them. Ends by saying that they still have opportunities to get a win.14:20 IST:The captains' interviews coming up...14:24 IST:Player of the Match - Michael Leask is the Player of the Match for his stellar all-round showing, cracking a 5-ball 22* and picking 4 wickets for 17. He says it was a full team performance. Tells that they have put in the hard work coming into the World Cup and have trained hard despite the limited lead-in time to the tournament. Leask notes that he was ready to attack anything within his hitting arc while emphasizing that the bowling unit had successfully applied vital lessons learned from their previous defeat against the West Indies. Adds that they got more from the surface today as compared to their previous game. Mentions that by winning today, they have given themselves a wonderful chance to qualify for the next round.14:30 IST:Italy's flame burned bright but quick - It is not the start Italy were looking for but they have shown sparks of brilliance. With the ball, they were a bit erratic but Ali Hasan showed great control up top and at the death as well. The likes of JJ Smuts and Grant Stewart also bowled well in patches but everyone else went for plenty of runs. With the bat, there were some positives as well, especially that partnership between Harry Manenti and Benjamin Manenti, worth 73 runs and that really kept Italy in the game. They did lose early wickets and once Ben fell after notching up a historic fifty, the wheels just came off and Italy folded like a pack of cards.14:11 IST:Scotland stepping up - It has been a roller-coaster of a ride for Scotland and after missing out on an entry into this T20 World Cup from the Qualifying rounds, they got a slice of luck as Bangladesh pulled out and Scotland made the cut. Today, they showed why they have been one of the most consistent associate nations, hammering 207 runs with the bat and then defending it with ease. George Munsey was prolific with the bat early on and gave his side a platform from where they could go on and score big. His 84 off 54 wasn't the only highlight of the batting innings but the cameo from Brandon McMullen, coupled with those boundaries in the final over from Michael Leask were equally important. On the bowling front, early wickets were key and it was Michael Leask, who led from the front with his four-fer. The spinners generally bowled well as Mark Watt picked up a couple of wickets as well and their catching was simply sensational as all 9 wickets were catches.14:04 IST:The experience of playing on the big stage - The scoreboard tells us that Scotland have completely dominated Italy in this game but it was more of a matter of playing the big moments well. Italy showed plenty of promise but the Scottish team had just too much experience in its ranks to avenge that defeat in the European Qualifiers last year.14:03 IST:Wayne Madsen is unfit to take any more part in the match and is given as absent hurt.14:48 IST:16.4: Brad Wheal to Ali Hasan, OUT! TAKEN! With Wayne Madsen making no move from the dugout, it's all over for the debutants. Brad Wheal delivers it on a good length, outside off, Ali Hasan swings only to balloon up his shot to cover. Richie Berrington runs back and takes a safe catch over his shoulder. SCOTLAND WIN BY 73 RUNS.14:02 IST:16.3: Brad Wheal to Ali Hasan, Short of a length, outside off, Hasan hangs his bat and checks his shot as he taps it to cover.14:01 IST:16.2: Brad Wheal to Crishan Kalugamage, Shorter delivery, nipping back in on the hips, Kalugamage tucks it to square leg for a single.14:01 IST:16.1: Brad Wheal to Crishan Kalugamage, Bowls a shorter delivery on off, Kalugamage bends his back and sways away to let it go.14:00 IST:With Wayne Madsen out of the game, Ali Hasan is the last batter in for Italy.Score 133/8BatsmanThomas Draca 2(5b 0*4 0*6)BowlerMark Watt 4-0-24-214:00 IST:15.6: Mark Watt to Thomas Draca, OUT! TAKEN! It's been a catching practise session lately for Scotland. Floats a fuller delivery on middle, Draca slog-sweeps on the shorter side but doesn't power it much. Hits it straight to Brandon McMullen at deep mid-wicket, who takes a dolly. It's falling apart rather quickly for Italy.13:59 IST:15.5: Mark Watt to Crishan Kalugamage, Slightly full and around off, Kalugamage crunches it to long off for a single.13:58 IST:15.4: Mark Watt to Crishan Kalugamage, Slows up the flighted delivery on middle, Kalugamage leans and defends it well.13:58 IST:15.3: Mark Watt to Thomas Draca, Angling on the pads, TD flicks it to deep square leg for a single.13:58 IST:15.2: Mark Watt to Thomas Draca, Pushed through, a bit quicker on leg, Draca gets inside the line to paddle it away but wears it outside on his pads.13:57 IST:15.1: Mark Watt to Thomas Draca, Almost chopped on! The armball, comes in by a long way, nipping in on middle, Thomas Draca goes back to flick it away but inside edges it onto the pads.Score 131/7BatsmanCrishan Kalugamage 1(2b 0*4 0*6)BowlerMichael Leask 4-0-17-413:56 IST:14.6: Michael Leask to Crishan Kalugamage, Fuller one at the stumps, squeezed away into the off side. 4-0-17-4, a sensational effort from Michael Leask. 13:56 IST:14.5: Michael Leask to Thomas Draca, Shortish length around off, dabbed down behind point for a single.13:56 IST:Scotland are in a hurry now. Thomas Draca replaces Gian-Piero Meade.13:55 IST:14.4: Michael Leask to Gian-Piero Meade, OUT! TAKEN! A four-fer for Michael Leask. Tossed up, fuller and on leg stump. Gian-Piero Meade clears the front leg to go big but doesn't quite get to the pitch of the delivery. Ends up chipping it down to Brandon McMullen at long on, who gobbles up an easy catch. Meade departs for a two-ball duck and Scotland are effectively two wickets away from the win.13:54 IST:14.3: Michael Leask to Gian-Piero Meade, Flatter one on the pads, nudged away towards mid-wicket.13:54 IST:14.2: Michael Leask to Crishan Kalugamage, Dragged short and angled across off, tapped away behind point for a single.13:55 IST:Michael Leask and George Munsey combine once again. The duo combine for the third time today. Also, the fourth catch for Munsey. Crishan Kalugamage walks to the middle. 13:53 IST:14.1: Michael Leask to Grant Stewart, OUT! CAUGHT! Things are falling apart rather quickly here for the Italians as George Munsey hangs on to his fourth catch of the game. Michael Leask uses that angle from around the wicket really well again. This is bowled a bit shorter and angled across off. Grant Stewart rocks back to hit it down the ground but lofts it down to long off where Munsey takes a simple catch. Leask has his third wicket as well.13:56 IST:DRINKS BREAK! Benjamin Manenti's wicket has settled the game in Scotland's favour. It's a stiff chase from hereon with the Italians a batter short as well. This chase will definitely test the batting depth of the debutants. Can Italy find motivation from somewhere, or will Scotland run through the line-up now? Gian-Piero Meade joins Grant Stewart in the middle. Score 129/5BatsmanBenjamin Manenti 52(31b 5*4 1*6)BowlerOliver Davidson 3-0-39-113:51 IST:13.6: Oliver Davidson to Benjamin Manenti, OUT! CAUGHT! Oliver Davidson has the last laugh and this might be the wicket that settles it for Scotland. Tossed-up delivery, full and around off. Benjamin Manenti hangs deep in the crease and plays the lofted drive over extra cover. There's not much elevation or power on it and Michael Jones takes a fine catch moving to his left from long off. Oliver Davidson gives a send-off to Manenti as well. Ben departs after making a fine 52 off just 31 balls but Italy are now 5 down for 129.13:48 IST:13.5: Oliver Davidson to Benjamin Manenti, Dragged length outside off, slapped away to the left of sweeper cover for a couple of runs more.13:47 IST:13.4: Oliver Davidson to Benjamin Manenti, SIX! Stand and deliver! Benjamin Manenti is the first Italian batter to score a FIFTY in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. This is bowled well short over middle, Manenti hangs back and dismissively swats it over long on for a biggie. A maiden T20I half-century for him as well.13:47 IST:13.3: Oliver Davidson to Grant Stewart, Flatter again, angled into the pads, tucked away through mid-wicket for a single.13:46 IST:13.2: Oliver Davidson to Benjamin Manenti, Flatter armball, darted into middle and leg, Manenti stays back and tucks it in front of mid-wicket for a single.13:45 IST:13.1: Oliver Davidson to Benjamin Manenti, FOUR! Wow, what a shot! Floated up, full and outside off, Benjamin Manenti leans back and smokes it flat over the cover region and the ball canters to the fence.13:46 IST:Change from both ends.

Just 2 runs and a wicket off the over, could be a game-changing one from Michael Leask.13:44 IST:12.5: Michael Leask to Grant Stewart, Good length around middle, Grant Stewart looks to flick it leg side but miscues it through mid off for a single.13:44 IST:12.4: Michael Leask to Grant Stewart, Pulls the length back by a couple of inches and attacks the middle stump.

CAUGHT! Straight to the man in the deep and that looked like a lazy shot from Harry Manenti. Michael Leask comes around the wicket and angles it across the off stump on a good length. Manenti stays leg side of the ball and lifts it high up but down the throat of the fielder at long off. George Munsey gobbles up his third catch of the game and the 73-run stand between the Manenti brothers is finally broken. Harry departs for 37 (25) and Italy are 113/4.13:41 IST:Michael Leask (2-0-13-1) is back on.Score 113/3BatsmanBenjamin Manenti 38(25b 4*4 0*6)BowlerMark Watt 3-0-22-113:40 IST:11.6: Mark Watt to Benjamin Manenti, Play and a miss!

Ben backs away to cut but misses. 13 runs off the over, 95 needed off 48 balls.13:39 IST:11.5: Mark Watt to Benjamin Manenti, Fuller and around off, stroked away wide of long off for another brace. It's easy batting right now for Italy.13:39 IST:11.4: Mark Watt to Benjamin Manenti, Dragged length around off, pushed away wide of deep cover for a couple of runs more by Benjamin Manenti.13:38 IST:11.3: Mark Watt to Benjamin Manenti, FOUR!

He was forced to leave the field in visible pain, leaving the Azzurri without their leader and most experienced batter for the chase. With the reports stated by Ian Bishop on air, it was confirmed that Wayne Madsen has dislocated his shoulder and will take no further part in the game. The Italians' bowling found hope through Ali Hasan, who was the pick of their lot but apart from that, they faltered on the wrong side mainly. The debutants have a mountain to climb for the first time, asking. Can they make a mark on the world stage by putting up a show? The chase is coming up.12:44 IST:Breakdown of Scotland's batting innings - Munsey was the heartbeat of the innings, falling just short of a century with a scintillating 84 off 54 balls. His opening partnership of 126 runs with Michael Jones completely deflated the Italian bowling attack early on. Brandon McMullen ensured the momentum didn't stall, smashing an unbeaten 41 off just 18 balls. Eventually, the flurry of boundaries from the bat of Michael Leask in the final over was what ultimately pushed Scotland past that 200-run barrier.12:39 IST:Scotland make merry at Eden Gardens - You’ve hit the nail on the head! This is a statement performance from the Scots. By crossing the 200-run mark, Scotland has not only set the highest total of the 2026 T20 World Cup so far, but they've done it with the kind of clinical aggression that silenced any doubts following their loss to the West Indies.12:35 IST:Hang on, we are not done yet.

Can Italy now calm their nerves and pick up a couple of more wickets, or at least slow down the scoring rate? Let's find out. 12:18 IST:13.4: Grant Stewart to George Munsey, FOUR!

That's classic Munsey. Full and outside off, GM walks across and inside the line of the ball, whipping it away through square leg and the fielder at deep backward square leg cannot cut it off.11:26 IST:5.2: Grant Stewart to George Munsey, Oh, extra bounce! Short of a good length and in the channel, the ball holds a bit in the deck and springs off the deck. Munsey has a poke at it but is beaten.11:24 IST:5.1: Grant Stewart to Michael Jones, Good-length delivery on the pads, Jones clips it away through square leg and turns the strike over.11:24 IST:Grant Stewart (1-0-7-0) returns to the attack.

Hasan bowls on the fuller side, across the eyeline of Jones, on leg, who fails to flick and wears it on the pads. It rolls to square leg for a single. It was anyways pitching outside leg.11:20 IST:Will Ali Hasan get a third over in a row? Yes, he will. 2 overs for 12 runs so far for Hasan.Score 34/0BatsmanGeorge Munsey 30(18b 6*4 0*6)BowlerThomas Draca 1-0-15-011:19 IST:3.6: Thomas Draca to George Munsey, A dot to end but 15 runs off the over.

Draca goes very full and bowls it outside off, Munsey hits it straight, his bat turns a bit but it allows him to hit it past the bowler and between mid on and mid off for four.11:17 IST:Uh, oh! That doesn't look good at all for Italy. Wayne Madsen seems to have overstretched that left arm while trying to stop the ball and might have just dislocated that left shoulder. He seems to be in a lot of pain and is going off the field for now. Hopefully, the Italian skipper is fine, but for now, it will be Harry Manenti to lead the side.11:15 IST:3.2: Thomas Draca to George Munsey, FOUR! Strong from Munsey! First boundary for Munsey on the leg side. Back of a length, outside off, Munsey pulls it to the left of the mid on fielder for a boundary. Oh, dear! The skipper of Italy, Wayne Madsen, was the fielder there and he hurt himself while diving across. He holds his left hand as he makes his way back to the dugout. 11:14 IST:3.2: Thomas Draca to George Munsey, WIDE! Shorter delivery, a bit too wide and almost over the tramline. Munsey swings his blade and misses.11:14 IST:3.1: Thomas Draca to George Munsey, Thomas Draca serves a fuller length delivery, outside off, George Munsey leans and punches it to cover.11:14 IST:Time for a bowling change?

Short in length, outside off, Munsey pulls it to the left of the mid on fielder, who dives across and stops it for a run. 500 runs for George Munsey in ICC Men's T20 World Cups, as mentioned by Ian Bishop on-air.11:11 IST:2.4: Ali Hasan to George Munsey, Nicely bowled! Gets it to nip back in a fraction around off and bowls it on the shorter side. Munsey tries to fend it away but ends up nudging it back on the deck.

Jones fends it in front of mid on and scampers across for a single.11:05 IST:1.1: Grant Stewart to Michael Jones, Right on the money! On a hard length and on middle and off, Michael Jones hangs back to defend it out.11:05 IST:The last two balls spoil a very decent first over for the Italians.

Munsey punches a bit uppishly and to the left of cover.11:01 IST:Done with the pre-match formalities and it is now time to play! Former T20 World Cup winner with West Indies, Samuel Badree, rings the bell signalling the start of play. The umpires are out in the middle and the Italians quickly get into a huddle before spreading out onto the field of play.

Mohammad Siraj (2/29) struck early, Arshdeep Singh (2/18) held his nerve at the death, and Axar Patel (2/24) tightened the screws through the middle overs as the USA were restricted to 132 for 8. It was not India at their most commanding, but they found a way to get the job done.advertisementIND vs USA T20 World Cup: Updates | Scorecard When the USA asked the tournament favourites to bat first, the talk quickly shifted to the possibility of a big total on a traditionally batting-friendly Wankhede surface. The expectation was understandable. India have crossed 250 three times since the last World Cup, and with a small ground, a true pitch and an associate opponent, conditions appeared ideal for a run-heavy contest.Instead, the night unfolded very differently. There was no sense of inevitability and no comfortable passage through the middle overs. Uncertainty crept in early and lingered. One by one, established names walked back, some in haste and others in frustration, leaving their captain to shoulder the responsibility almost alone. Drawing on his experience at his home ground, Suryakumar chose discipline over desperation even as a spirited USA side had India reeling at 77 for 6.Dropped on 15, Suryakumar eventually broke free with a late surge that featured 10 fours and four sixes, lifting India from 128 for 7 after 18 overs to a fighting 161 for 9, a total that proved just enough once the bowlers took control.SHADLEY STUNS HOSTS IN PPUSA sensed vulnerability from the first over and responded with composure well beyond their status. Shadley van Schalkwyk, bowling with control and confidence, set the tone with a spell that exposed India's discomfort on a surface offering uneven bounce and little rhythm. His figures told only part of the story; more telling was how often Indian batters were forced into indecision, prodding, and second-guessing.India's opening moments hinted at the struggle to come. The first four deliveries passed without a run as the batters were pinned down by tight lines and fields that denied easy singles. Ishan Kishan briefly lifted the mood with a six, but the release was fleeting and did little to settle nerves.Abhishek Sharma fell first ball of the second over, driving Ali Khan straight to deep cover. The early wicket brought a hush over the Wankhede, replaced by a growing unease. USA captain Monank Patel responded by tightening the screws, keeping his fields straight and compact, forcing Indian batters to manufacture shots rather than play naturally.advertisementTilak Varma attempted to shift the tempo. He danced down the pitch to Saurabh Netravalkar and then found his timing against van Schalkwyk, threading a few boundaries through the infield. For a brief passage, it appeared India had found a foothold. The moment, however, passed quickly.Kishan, after striking another clean six, squandered a reprieve and picked out mid-on first ball of the sixth over. Van Schalkwyk struck again soon after, as Tilak mistimed a pull off a short ball that climbed awkwardly, offering a straightforward catch. Shivam Dube followed without scoring, deceived by a slower bouncer that took away both balance and intent.From there, the innings unravelled steadily. Rinku Singh struggled to find fluency and holed out to long-on. Hardik Pandya failed to clear the sweeper at cover. Axar Patel's late attempt to force the pace only extended the list of departures. At every turn, the USA appeared calmer, sharper and increasingly assured, feeding off India's uncertainty.SKY CARRIES ON HIS RESCUE ACTSuryakumar's 49-ball knock, stitched together with 10 fours and four sixes, was less about freedom and more about survival. When India slumped to 77 for six in the 13th over, the prospect of even a competitive total looked distant. By the time the innings closed at 161 for nine, it was clear the number existed largely because one man refused to surrender for the evening.advertisementThrough it all, Suryakumar recalibrated. He farmed the strike carefully, accepted periods of quiet, and trusted his reading of the pitch. While wickets fell around him, he focused on staying present, nudging singles and waiting for bowlers to stray.When he was put down early in his innings, it felt like a moment that might linger. USA's evening, so tightly controlled until then, began to fray. Injuries to Ali Khan and Shubham Ranjane disrupted their plans, forcing reshuffles that Suryakumar was quick to identify and exploit. Netravalkar, already enduring a difficult return to his home ground, bore the brunt as Suryakumar began to open his shoulders.The USA would rue the missed chance. Ranjane, who had once played under Suryakumar's captaincy in India, dropped him on 15. Ali Khan was forced off injured after two economical overs, and Ranjane later followed. The control they had exerted slipped just enough for Suryakumar to seize the moment.advertisementSensing the shift, he finally broke free in the closing overs. The last two overs yielded 34 runs, including a final over that swung the mood of the innings just enough. It did not disguise the collapse that preceded it, but it gave India something tangible to defend.For a while, it felt like India had left the door ajar. A below-par 161 for 9 sat uneasily on the board, the kind of total that asks questions rather than offering comfort. But when the bowlers took over on Saturday night, those doubts began to fade, ball by ball, wicket by wicket.ARSHDEEP, SIRAJ STRIKE BACKUSA, in reply, were restricted to 132 for 8, a subdued batting effort that contrasted sharply with their discipline in the first innings when their bowlers kept India on a tight leash and backed it up in the field.India set the tone immediately. Arshdeep Singh delivered a probing opening over that conceded just a single run, building quiet pressure from the outset. At the other end, Mohammed Siraj, returning to T20Is after last playing in 2024 and drafted in at short notice, struck in his first over by removing Andries Gous. Arshdeep soon found reward as well, a leading edge from captain Monank Patel floating to mid-off. Siraj followed up by dismissing Saiteja Mukkamalla, and within four overs the USA were reeling at 13 for 3.advertisementThere was brief resistance from Milind Kumar and Sanjay Krishnamurthi, who ran hard, trusted their defence and stitched together the USA's most meaningful partnership of the night. For a short while, the chase steadied. India responded with patience rather than panic, turning to spin to slow the tempo and maintain control.Perfect start to #TeamIndia’s campaignStep 1 completed in the mission to Repeat & Defeat History!ICC Men’s #T20WorldCup | #INDvNAM | THU, FEB 12 | 6 PM pic.twitter.com/bC9yNNPnjI— Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) February 7, 2026The stand ended in confusion. Varun Chakravarthy beat Milind's inside edge as the batter stepped out, and although Ishan Kishan initially fumbled, he recovered to complete the stumping. The 58-run partnership was broken, and much of the USA's momentum went with it.From there, India tightened their grip. Axar Patel removed the set Krishnamurthi for 37, drawing a mis-hit that Rinku Singh safely held at deep mid-wicket. The very next ball, Harmeet Singh attempted to force the pace and holed out, giving Axar two wickets in two deliveries.Milind Kumar (34), Shubham Ranjane (37) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (37) fought with resolve, but none could dominate for long. Once Varun Chakravarthy (1/24) and Axar Patel (2/24) took charge after the Powerplay, conceding just 48 runs and picking up three wickets in eight overs, the chase never truly recovered.Siraj, who replaced an indisposed Jasprit Bumrah after joining the squad late on Friday, finished with 3 for 29 from four overs, his fuller length proving decisive early. Having slipped to 13 for 3 inside the fourth over, the USA were always playing catch-up, and their fight gradually petered out.India left the Wankhede having navigated a tricky evening, aware that sterner tests await when they face Namibia on Thursday, February 12, at Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Feb 7, 2026Read More | Kolkata's Eden debunks attendance fears, turns up for Scotland vs West IndiesMust Watch Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchMalayalam actor Maniyanpilla Raju's car hits bike, flees spot; 2 injuredChaiwala ko chai: PM Modi’s light moment with student at Pariksha Pe CharchaVideo: Biker blocks car, vandalises it and abuses techie in Bengaluru road rageAdvertisementRead ThisCan Surat, among world’s fastest-growing cities, be one of its most liveable?No horsing around?

Scoops, sweeps, redefined angles, and resolve indicate he is ready to solve his legacy problem AdvertisementT20 World Cup: India's captain, Suryakumar Yadav played a big role in India getting their opening win. (Image: AP)Sandipan SharmaNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 8, 2026 07:26 ISTPosted By: Amar Sunil PanickerThe ball was gripping the surface in Mumbai. Ishan Kishan was in comical misery, his innings stretched only by a spilt chance. Abhishek Sharma had completed his familiar routine of golden duck on odd days and golden bat on even days. And the 14-year-old prodigy was nowhere in sight.Nothing, absolutely nothing, was adding up for India against the United States of America on the opening day of the T20 World Cup 2026. Somewhere in Colombo, Pakistan were busy calculating, working out permutations, running numbers, and imagining excuses.advertisementIND vs USA T20 World Cup 2026: Updates | Scorecard Then walked in cricket’s greatest 'mathemagician,' Suryakumar Yadav, with his theorem of chaos. Problem solved.Laws of Probability and HistoryRules of probability rarely apply when India bats these days. Almost every time, they perform like an exponential curve, climbing higher and higher on the charts.Saturday was an aberration and a potential embarrassment. India were 77/6. The 240+ formula had collapsed. Variables eliminated: Abhishek (duck), Ishan (20), Tilak (25), Dube (duck), Rinku Singh (6), Hardik Pandya (5). The pressure was compounding like a defaulted loan.Minnows have a history of destroying the Indian calculus at World Cups. 1983 vs. Zimbabwe (almost), 1999 vs. Zimbabwe again, and 2007 vs. Bangladesh. This is our equation now, the USA players must have told themselves.But Surya doesn't bat. The field sets the problem, and he solves it in real time. Suryakumar Yadav finds the gap he wants regardless of the field. (Image: AP) While others see a packed offside, he sees angles. Acute ones behind point, obtuse ones over extra cover. Impossible ones behind fine leg.The bowler puts a man at deep third and fires a yorker wide outside the off stump. Surya moves towards point, gets under the ball, and digs it over the keeper's head.Fine leg creeps in? He opens the face and redraws the diagram without a compass. Every wrist flick is a theorem, every scoop a proof of contradiction.He doesn’t hit where the field is. He hits where the field can’t be. Lines are extended, arcs are completed, and suddenly the circle is broken again.This isn’t batting. This is applied mathematics at 140 km/h. That's why he’s Mr 360 degrees.Calculate The DifferenceProfessor Surya held a masterclass at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai with invisible tools: the wand, the compass, and the calculator. Suryakumar Yadav bisects the field with ease. Image: AP The USA bowlers first set fields for conventional strokes, SKY bisected it. In the closing stages of the innings, Saurabh Netravalkar set the field for unconventional shots, but Surya bisected it. Scoops, lap sweeps, cover drives, the off-balance sixes. In the end, the field became his grid; every gap a coordinate he'd already plotted.The tally – 84* off 49 balls, 10 fours and 4 sixes, single-handedly dragging India from 77/6 to 161/9. Not just runs, but an answer to the question: What happens when cricket meets geometry?Mystery of the Surya LegacyAnd yet, the Suryakumar Yadav legacy remains an unresolved equation.By any conventional measure, he is a great batter, one of the most inventive the format has seen. And still, the record in World Cups throws up anomalies. No defining innings in a marquee World Cup game, and a history of big-stage flops.It is surprising. Not because he lacks skills or the big stage temperament. With the gum in his mouth and the bat in his hand, he often gives the Viv Richards vibes–confident, defiant, almost disdainful. His batting and swag feel made for moments of chaos, the very moments that decide big tournaments. Suryakumar Yadav single-handedly helped India win. (Image: AP) advertisementYet, the image that only lingers from the grandest stage isn’t a boundary, but a catch in the 2024 final. A leap that seemed to suspend time, a hand that found the ball where physics said it shouldn’t. In a career built on bending angles with the bat, it is ironic that his most enduring World Cup memory is of a catch that defied geometry and probability in the field.Perhaps that, too, is part of the Surya paradox.The Final Solution?But this time, the signs feel different. The form is undeniable since the bilateral series with New Zealand. The clarity and resolve are unmistakable. Maybe, as poet Chand Bardai wrote in his book on Prithviraj Chauhan: This time don't miss, Chauhan.advertisementThe innings against the USA wasn’t a cameo or a counterpunch; it was a captain’s knock, shaped by responsibility as much as imagination. It had the stamp of a man hungry for his legacy, convinced of his destiny.A fine innings from the man in top form! @surya_14kumar brings up his 25th T20I fifty, just when the team needed it the most!PS.

Where the end goal is no longer calculated chaos, but the World Cup.Let's hope this time, the equation isn’t about brilliance but about arriving at the answer to the bewildering problem of Surya’s defining legacy.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Amar PanickerPublished On: Feb 8, 2026Read More: | Shubman Gill enjoys Man United's win over Spurs during India's T20 World Cup openerMust Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchVideo: Terrifying moment when 'tsunami' swing snaps mid-air, crashes to groundUS trade deal shows India’s confidence, not compromise: Piyush GoyalTime doesn't heal anything, it gives you strength to carry weight: Usha UthupAdvertisementRead ThisAquarius Tarot Horoscope Today (Jan 20- Feb 19), February 8, 2026: Will meditate, plan to buy a big houseCapricorn Tarot Horoscope Today (Dec 22-Jan 19), February 8, 2026: Spend Less, New Relationships May FormSagittarius Tarot Horoscope Today (Nov 22- Dec 21), February 8, 2026: Lottery May Win, Do Not RushTRENDING TOPICST20 World CupT20 World Cup ScheduleT20 World Cup Points TableAdvertisement

AdvertisementT20 World Cup 2026: India were reduced to 46/4 in the batting powerplay. (Image: AP)India Today Sports DeskMumbai,UPDATED: Feb 7, 2026 20:46 ISTWritten By: Amar Sunil PanickerThe defending T20 champions, India, were given a crushing reality check during their T20 World Cup 2026 opener against the United States of America, with the associate nation delivering what could be deemed a rather shocking start to their campaign.20 World Cup 2026, IND vs USA: Live Updates | ScorecardComing into this fixture, many perceived that India would walk in and dominate, as they have in bilateral games played before. The broadcasters had been hyping up the prospect of India reaching the magical 300-run mark, almost dismissing USA as just another associate team that would be swept aside. But the fearless intent was brought to a crashing halt as India were reduced to 46/4 in the batting powerplay at the famed Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai—a venue deemed a batting paradise where India had previously scored their highest T20 total.advertisement Who could blame the pre-match optimism, really, considering the way India had been playing? They haven't lost a single series since the previous T20 World Cup and, by all means, have looked unbeatable, scoring 200+ totals with such ease.The pre-match graphics even flashed "300 ALERT!" across screens, such was the confidence in India's batting prowess. But India's luck might have finally run out—no pun intended—with the batting unit being completely outdone by the American squad on home soil.Monank Patel's Bold StatementAfter winning the toss and choosing to bowl first, the USA made a statement of intent when captain Monank Patel opted to field, showing confidence in chasing down whatever India would muster up. But no one could have anticipated the USA putting up such a performance.Right from the get-go, the Indian batters were under the pump. Ishan Kishan appeared under pressure with Saurabh Netravalkar getting the ball to nip back into the left-hander. Cramping Kishan for room, the wicketkeeper-batter who had been in hot form looked like a completely different person.India remained in this precarious situation despite the USA having dropped two catches during the powerplay. One can only imagine what the scoreline would have been if the USA had held onto those chances.Van Schalkwyk MasterclassShadley van Schalkwyk, the South Africa-origin medium pacer, left the Wankhede Stadium in shock. Getting rid of Ishan Kishan, Tilak Varma, and Shivam Dube in the final over of the powerplay was a sight to behold. It just goes to show that no matter how good you may be, things can change in the blink of an eye. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ICC (@icc)The pitch report by broadcaster and former England cricketer Nick Knight had deemed it one where runs would be galore. Yet it turned out to be the complete opposite. The track was two-paced with some movement for the seamers and the ball turning considerably for the spinners, particularly with the flighted delivery.Where Is the Fearlessness?advertisementDuring the pre-match press conference, Suryakumar Yadav had emphasised how the fearless approach India has been known for under Gautam Gambhir's coaching is something they wanted to maintain. But it turned out to be the complete opposite. The Indian batters seemed flustered when they realised it was a two-paced track, and all that fearless approach went out the window."We used to play bilaterals and ICC tournaments in different ways. But now, whether it's the Asia Cup, an ICC event, or a bilateral series, we play the same way," Yadav had said. "That's why when we went to the ICC event in 2024, it didn't feel so different—because we were playing that kind of cricket the whole year."The gulf between words and execution was evident as India struggled to adapt, raising serious questions about their tournament preparations heading into the crucial matches ahead.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Amar PanickerPublished On: Feb 7, 2026Read More: | IND vs USA: Sanju Samson dropped, Jasprit Bumrah rested due to illnessMust Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchMalayalam actor Maniyanpilla Raju's car hits bike, flees spot; 2 injuredChaiwala ko chai: PM Modi’s light moment with student at Pariksha Pe CharchaVideo: Biker blocks car, vandalises it and abuses techie in Bengaluru road rageAdvertisementRead ThisIndia agreed to open agriculture, dairy sectors to US players?

Pak board, ICC in talks over boycott threatIndia vs Pakistan match still on? Pak board, ICC in talks over boycott threat T20 World Cup 2026: The Pakistan Cricket Board has agreed to engage in further dialogue with the International Cricket Council after the global body questioned the Force Majeure clause invoked to justify boycotting the February 15 match against India in Colombo.AdvertisementPakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi (Getty Images)Nikhil NazNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 7, 2026 18:30 ISTWritten By: Akshay RameshA glimmer of hope that the India–Pakistan clash will go ahead as scheduled on February 15? Perhaps. But the off-field drama at the T20 World Cup shows no signs of fading, even as the tournament got underway across India and Sri Lanka on February 7.The International Cricket Council (ICC) has finally received official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) outlining the Pakistan government’s decision to boycott the February 15 match against India — a move that has opened the door for further dialogue between the two bodies.advertisementSources familiar with the matter say the ICC has approached the issue in line with how it has handled similar sensitive situations in the past, prioritising process, precedent and engagement over confrontation. The focus, it is understood, has been on safeguarding the sanctity of the T20 World Cup while keeping player welfare, fan interest and organisational fairness at the centre of its decision-making. The sequence of events began after the Pakistan government publicly announced that its team would not take the field against India despite agreeing to play the rest of the tournament. Shortly afterwards, the PCB formally wrote to the ICC invoking the ‘Force Majeure’ clause, attaching the government’s public statement but offering no additional explanation or justification.That move prompted a measured yet firm response from the ICC. Rather than dismissing the claim outright, the world body asked the PCB to explain how Force Majeure could apply to a single fixture while participation in the remaining matches continued. The ICC also sought clarity on what steps Pakistan had taken to mitigate the situation — including whether alternatives were explored, exemptions sought or solutions proposed before opting for non-participation.Following receipt of the ICC’s detailed response, the PCB has since reached out to initiate further dialogue. An ICC official confirmed that discussions are currently underway in a structured manner to explore possible resolutions.Notably, Pakistan delayed formally writing to the ICC, allowing speculation to dominate for several days after the Pakistan government first tweeted about the proposed boycott. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated the government’s stance last week, further underlining the political dimension of the issue.WHAT IS FORCE MAJEURE?Force majeure is a contractual provision that excuses a party from fulfilling its obligations due to extraordinary events beyond its control, such as war, natural disasters or government action.To invoke it, the affected party must demonstrate that the event was unavoidable, directly prevented performance, and that all reasonable steps were taken to mitigate its impact. In sporting contracts, an unjustified invocation of force majeure can carry serious legal and commercial consequences.In its communication to the PCB, the ICC outlined the high evidentiary threshold required to justify non-participation, the conditions under which the clause can be legitimately triggered, and the wider sporting, commercial and governance implications of such a step. Sources say the PCB was also made aware that an invalid invocation could expose it to damages, sanctions and potential breach-of-contract claims.advertisementLast week, while awaiting formal confirmation from the PCB, the ICC also flagged the long-term implications of such a move, including its potential impact on the global cricket ecosystem.Despite the firm tone of its response, the ICC has kept channels of dialogue open and is continuing to engage with the PCB in a structured manner, with the view that the interests of the game must supersede unilateral action.Only on Friday, a report claimed that the PCB was willing to consult its government over its boycott stance after Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) wrote to Pakistan, urging it to reconsider the decision and detailing the potential financial impact a boycott could have on the host nation.HOW MUCH WILL THE ICC LOSE IN CASE OF A BOYCOTT?An India–Pakistan World Cup clash generates revenue to the tune of Rs 2,200 crore, according to news agency PTI.If Pakistan remain adamant, they risk losing millions in revenues, while a no-show would also inflict significant financial damage on the ICC and India’s media rights holder, JioStar, which is already attempting to renegotiate a USD 3 billion deal with the world body.advertisementThe host broadcaster could face advertisement revenue losses ranging from Rs 200 crore to Rs 250 crore for a marquee fixture where a 10-second commercial slot can cost up to Rs 40 lakh.WILL INDIA TRAVEL TO COLOMBO?India Today has learnt from reliable top sources that the Indian team will proceed as per schedule for the match. This includes travelling to Sri Lanka, as planned, had the fixture gone ahead in the normal course.The team will also continue with their training schedule and fulfil pre-match media commitments. India are expected to arrive at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on time and will wait for the match referee’s decision should Pakistan fail to turn up for the game.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Feb 7, 2026Must Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchMalayalam actor Maniyanpilla Raju's car hits bike, flees spot; 2 injuredChaiwala ko chai: PM Modi’s light moment with student at Pariksha Pe CharchaVideo: Biker blocks car, vandalises it and abuses techie in Bengaluru road rageAdvertisementRead ThisAs Census nears, Kerala govt repeats no-National Population Register positionMan leaves bodies of wife, son in mortuary to attend SIR hearing in BengalAneet Padda, Ahaan Panday's Saiyaara re-released in theatres?

Beyond the threat of severe sanctions from the International Cricket Council, the tournament's broadcaster may take legal action against the Pakistan Cricket Board if the senior national team boycotts the February 15 match against India.AdvertisementPakistan has said its senior national team will not play India in T20 World Cup (Courtesy: Getty Images)Press Trust of IndiaNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 9, 2026 10:21 ISTPosted By: Akshay RameshThe ICC has warned the Pakistan Cricket Board that it faces the prospect of legal action from T20 World Cup's official broadcaster, JioStar, for boycotting its February 15 game against India, a PCB source said on Tuesday.Pakistan decided to boycott the match in Colombo on February 15 on the instructions of their government, but haven't yet officially specified the reasons to ICC.advertisementAs reported by PTI, there is a possibility that the ICC will withhold the entire annual revenue share of Pakistan, which is around USD 35 million and pay the broadcasters from that purse. Also Read: ICC braces for USD 250 million loss if no India vs Pak game A PCB source informed that although chairman Mohsin Naqvi had taken advice from the board's legal experts before briefing PM Shehbaz Sharif on the issue last week, the board is bracing for some serious consequences."If Pakistan doesn't relent and play against India, not only will they face financial penalties, perhaps a lawsuit from broadcasters, but also any efforts to go to the ICC Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) are likely to fail," a PCB source told PTI.ICC's DRC is an internal committee which doesn't hear appeals against the decisions made by its own board."The PCB might face problems regardless of their government directive to not play India as they are playing all their matches at a neutral venue (Sri Lanka) as per their wishes and not in India," another PCB source said."Secondly, while the Indian government has not given permission to its team to play in Pakistan, it has not stopped them from playing against Pakistan at neutral venues in Asia Cup or ICC events even after the May conflict," the board source, who tracks Naqvi closely, added.The PCB is yet to communicate in writing to the ICC, but the boycott decision is being seen as an act of solidarity with Bangladesh after their ouster."When the ICC signed its four-year deal with the broadcaster for all ICC events, the contract included Pakistan and India matches based on which the broadcaster made the payments to the ICC," the source explained."So the broadcaster will be within its rights to take the PCB and ICC to court over a major breach of the contract."WILL NAQVI MAKE U-TURN AFTER BANGLADESH ELECTIONS?There is a school of thought that Naqvi, who is also the interior minister of his country, might just make a U-turn once the general elections are held in Bangladesh on February 12 and a democratic government takes charge instead of the present one headed by Muhammad Yunus.advertisement"Naqvi more than a cricket administrator, is a politician, who is not one bit bothered about the welfare of the national team. He is trying to score a brownie point with his and could well flip once elections are held on February 12."There would still be two days before the India game and things could just change. Else he knows that Pakistan could be ostracised," another source tracking Pakistan cricket said.- EndsPublished By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Feb 3, 2026Tune InMust Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchCongress Slams BJP Over Deleted Video Of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Taking AimConspiracy or medical negligence?

Italy and Channel Islanders Jersey both finished the qualifiers on five points after registering surprise victories over Scotland. However, it was the Italians who secured second place behind the Netherlands on the back of a superior net run rate, sealing their maiden berth at the global showpiece.Italy have enjoyed a strong run of form leading into the tournament, winning their last three matches. They recorded victories in warm-up fixtures against Canada and the UAE before defeating Ireland in their build-up series, a landmark result that marked their first-ever victory over an ICC Full Member.Scotland, on the other hand, arrive into the fixture after suffering a 35-run defeat against West Indies in their opening game at the same venue. Chasing a target of 183, Scotland were bowled out for 147, with captain Richie Berrington standing tall as the lone bright spot with a knock of 42 off 24 deliveries. With the ball, left-arm seamer Brad Currie (2/23) emerged as the pick of the bowlers.advertisementScotland and Italy share a rich sporting rivalry, highlighted recently when Italy edged Scotland 18–15 in a tightly contested Six Nations rugby clash in Rome, adding another layer of intrigue for fans of both nations. In cricketing terms, the sides have been evenly matched, with each team winning one of the two matches played between them. However, Italy will head into the fixture brimming with confidence after their 12-run victory over Scotland in last year’s European qualifier.Pitch ReportThe opening fixture at Eden Gardens in Kolkata produced a balanced surface with something on offer for both batters and bowlers. Batters enjoyed free stroke play, while bowlers were able to extract assistance when hitting the right areas. Kolkata traditionally favours spinners, and skilful tweakers are expected to enjoy bowling on this surface, while batters will need to spend time in the middle before attempting expansive strokes.Predicted Playing XIsScotland: George Munsey, Matthew Cross (wk), Brandon McMullen, Michael Jones, Tom Bruce, Richie Berrington (c), Michael Leask, Oliver Davidson, Mark Watt, Brad Currie, Safyaan SharifadvertisementItaly: Justin Mosca, Wayne Madsen (c), Harry Manenti, Anthony Mosca, JJ Smuts, Ben Manenti, Grant Stewart, Gian Meade (wk), Marcus Campopiano, Crishan Kalugamage, Ali HasanMATCH 2 Prediction: Zimbabwe vs Oman in ColomboZimbabwe secured qualification for the tournament by winning the ICC T20 World Cup Africa Regional Qualifier. However, they were unable to carry that momentum into the build-up, suffering a 0–3 defeat against Afghanistan and managing just one win in the subsequent tri-series involving Pakistan and Sri Lanka.The Chevrons last featured in the 2022 edition of the tournament, where they were knocked out during the group stage. Nevertheless, the Sikandar Raza-led side has played an exciting brand of cricket in recent years and will be eager to spring a few surprises in the upcoming edition.Oman, meanwhile, qualified for the World Cup after finishing second in the ICC T20 World Cup Asia & EAP Qualifier. They also featured in the Asia Cup Rising Stars tournament but managed only one win from three matches against the UAE. In the previous World Cup edition, Oman were eliminated in the first stage, losing all four of their Group B fixtures.advertisementHowever, Oman have enjoyed a positive build-up to the tournament, winning both of their warm-up matches against Sri Lanka A and Zimbabwe. Their victory over the Sikandar Raza-led side will give them significant confidence heading into the opening fixture as they aim to start their campaign on a winning note.Pitch ReportThe opening match of the tournament between Pakistan and the Netherlands was played at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo. Batting first, the Dutch were bowled out for 147, while Pakistan faced hiccups during the middle overs of the chase before Faheem Ashraf guided them home. Spinners are expected to enjoy bowling on the surface, while seamers could also find success by varying their pace. Batters will need to apply themselves early before attempting aggressive stroke play.Predicted Playing XIOman: Jatinder Singh (c), Hammad Mirza (wk), Ashish Odedra, Vinayak Shukla, Jiten Ramanandi, Aamir Kaleem, Nadeem Khan, Jay Odedra, Shakeel Ahmed, Sufyan Mehmood, Faisal ShahZimbabwe: Brendon Taylor (wk), Brian Bennett, Dion Mayers, Clive Madande, Sikandar Raza (c), Ryan Burl, Brad Evans, Wellington Masakadza, Graeme Cremer, Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava T20 World Cup: South Africa will play their opening game against Canada in Ahmedabad advertisementMATCH 3 Prediction: South Africa vs Canada in AhmedabadSouth Africa enter the tournament with renewed belief following their triumph in the ICC World Test Championship final in 2025. The Aiden Markram-led side recently defeated West Indies 2–1 in the lead-up to the tournament, although they suffered a 30-run defeat against hosts India in their only warm-up match.Once again, South Africa arrive at an ICC event with all the ingredients required to challenge for the title. Whether they can hold their nerve during crunch moments, particularly in the knockout stages, remains to be seen. The Proteas endured heartbreak in the final of the 2024 edition against India, and that painful defeat is likely to serve as added motivation as they look to put the setback behind them and seek redemption should they encounter the defending champions again.Canada, meanwhile, qualified for the tournament by winning the T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier. Their build-up, however, has been far from ideal, having lost both warm-up fixtures against Italy and Nepal. This will be Canada’s second appearance at the T20 World Cup, after being eliminated during the group stage of the previous edition.The Canadians did manage to register a memorable victory over Ireland on debut and will be keen to add more wins to their tally as they look to make an impact in their second appearance at the T20 extravaganza.Pitch ReportA total of eight T20I matches have been played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, with five of those games won by teams batting first. The surface favours big hitters, with the average first-innings score standing at 188. The highest successful run chase at the venue is 165. While dew is expected to play a role in the second half, captains are still likely to opt for batting first to take advantage of the favourable conditions.Predicted Playing XISouth Africa: Aiden Markram (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Ryan Rickelton, Dewald Brevis, Jason Smith, Tristan Stubbs, George Linde, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi NgidiCanada: Navneet Dhaliwal, Yuvraj Samra, Kanwarpal Tathgur, Nicholas Kirton, Dilpreet Bajwa (c), Harsh Thaker, Shreyas Movva (wk), Ansh Patel, Jaskaran Singh, Shivam Sharma, Dilon HeyligerT20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Feb 9, 2026Must Watch Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchCongress Slams BJP Over Deleted Video Of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Taking AimConspiracy or medical negligence?

He will assume office on July 7, 2025, becoming the seventh CEO in the history of the ICC.Live TVShareAdvertisementICC appoints Sanjog Gupta as Chief Executive Officer (Star Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Jul 7, 2025 13:05 ISTThe International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday announced the appointment of Sanjog Gupta as its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Gupta will officially assume charge on July 7, 2025, becoming the seventh person to hold the post.A veteran of India's sports and media ecosystem, Gupta currently serves as CEO of Sports & Live Experiences at JioStar. With over two decades of experience across content, strategy, and operations, he has been widely credited with shaping the modern sports broadcast landscape in India.advertisementICC Chairman Jay Shah welcomed Gupta's appointment, calling him a visionary leader whose expertise would prove vital in the organisation's next phase of growth. "Sanjog brings extensive experience in sports strategy and commercialisation, which will be invaluable for the ICC," Shah said. "His deep understanding of global sports, media and entertainment, along with his passion for technology and the cricket fan's perspective, will be essential as we seek to expand cricket's reach-especially with Olympic inclusion on the horizon."Gupta was appointed following a rigorous global recruitment process that attracted more than 2,500 applicants from 25 countries. After multiple rounds of shortlisting, the ICC's Nominations Committee, comprising Imran Khwaja, Richard Thompson, Shammi Silva, and Devajit Saikia, unanimously recommended Gupta. The decision was later ratified by the full ICC Board.In his first remarks after being named CEO-designate, Gupta described his new role as a "privilege" and emphasised his commitment to taking cricket to new frontiers."These are exciting times for the sport as marquee events grow in stature, commercial avenues widen, and opportunities such as the women's game scale in popularity," Gupta said. "Cricket's inclusion in the LA28 Olympics and rapid technological advances present game-changing possibilities. I look forward to working closely with ICC Member Boards to expand cricket's global footprint and enhance fan experience."Starting his career as a journalist, Gupta joined Star India in 2010 and rose through the ranks to lead its sports business. As Head of Sports at Disney Star from 2020, he helped drive innovations such as multi-language broadcasts, digital-first programming, and women-centric coverage, while significantly boosting the popularity of properties like the IPL, ICC events, and domestic leagues such as the ISL and PKL.Gupta was appointed CEO of JioStar Sports in November 2024 after the merger of Viacom18 and Disney Star, leading a consolidated sports media powerhouse.- EndsPublished By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jul 7, 2025Read More | Seam, skid and spirit: Akash Deep turns Edgbaston into spectacle of English mayhemWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchVideo: Terrifying moment when 'tsunami' swing snaps mid-air, crashes to groundUS trade deal shows India’s confidence, not compromise: Piyush GoyalTime doesn't heal anything, it gives you strength to carry weight: Usha UthupAdvertisementRead ThisIndian engineers now designing 2nm chips, IT minister says work is on to make high-end chips herePremier League: Carrick’s United surge grows as Arsenal depth fuels title pushInvolves national security: Assam sends Gaurav Gogoi's 'Pak links' case to CentreTRENDING TOPICSIND vs USA Live ScorecardT20 World CupT20 World Cup ScheduleT20 World Cup Points TableAdvertisement

Pakistan were set to clash against India on February 15 in Colombo.AdvertisementPakistan will not play India in the T20 World Cup. (PTI Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 2, 2026 00:22 ISTIn an unprecedented move, Pakistan on Sunday confirmed its participation in the T20 World Cup 2026 but announced that it will boycott its group-stage match against arch-rivals India. The decision was taken by the Government of Pakistan after the International Cricket Council (ICC) removed Bangladesh from the tournament following Dhaka’s refusal to play matches in India citing security concerns.The development comes despite prior agreements between the ICC, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to hold all India–Pakistan fixtures at neutral venues. Notably, the Pakistani government did not spell out a specific reason for opting out of the February 15 fixture against India.advertisementEarlier, the PCB had publicly backed Bangladesh during an ICC vote that asked member nations to ratify Dhaka’s request for a venue change. Pakistan and Bangladesh were the only two boards to support the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), while 14 other nations rejected the request, stating that the security threat did not warrant a shift away from India. What did Pakistan Say?“The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan Cricket Team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026,” the government said in a statement posted on X.However, it added that “the Pakistan Cricket Team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February 2026 against India.” Pakistan to boycott India game in T20 World Cup. What Did ICC Say?In response to Pakistan’s announcement, the International Cricket Council expressed serious concern over the implications of a team choosing to participate selectively in a global tournament.The ICC said it recognises the authority of governments in matters related to foreign policy, but underlined that directing a national side to skip a scheduled match is incompatible with the basic framework of an international sporting event. All teams that qualify for ICC tournaments are expected to compete under the same conditions and adhere to the agreed match schedule.The governing body pointed out that ICC competitions are founded on principles of fairness, integrity and competitive balance, and warned that selective participation weakens those foundations and damages the credibility of the event.While stating that it is still awaiting formal communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board, the ICC made it clear that such a decision does not serve the interests of the sport or its global fanbase, including supporters within Pakistan.The ICC also urged the PCB to carefully assess the broader and long-term consequences of the move, noting that any disruption could have a ripple effect across the international cricket ecosystem, of which Pakistan is an active member and beneficiary.Emphasising that its primary focus remains the smooth conduct of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, the ICC said delivering a successful tournament is a shared responsibility of all member boards. It expressed hope that the PCB would engage in discussions to find a solution acceptable to all parties involved.advertisementThe ICC’s Playing Conditions also outline clear consequences should Pakistan forfeit the match. A team that does not take the field is considered to have completed a full 20-over innings, with those overs included in the calculation of run rate.Such a forfeit would lead to a sharp drop in Pakistan’s Net Run Rate, potentially affecting their group-stage standing and qualification prospects.What is India's Stance?While the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is yet to issue an official statement, it is reliably learnt that the board is awaiting formal communication from the International Cricket Council (ICC) on the matter.According to top sources, the Indian team will proceed strictly as per ICC protocol. The side is expected to travel to Sri Lanka as scheduled and carry out its routine pre-match preparations, including training sessions and the mandatory pre-match press conference. India will arrive at the R Premadasa Stadium at the designated time on match day and will wait for the match referee to take a call on calling off the fixture should Pakistan choose not to take the field.advertisementPakistan Boycott India: Will ICC Take a Hit?The India–Pakistan clash remains the most lucrative fixture in global cricket. To capitalise on that appeal, the ICC have placed the two teams in the same group at every major tournament since 2012, even as worsening diplomatic relations have ruled out bilateral cricket for the last 14 years.If Pakistan maintain their stance, the T20 World Cup 2026 will become the first men’s ICC tournament since 2010 not to feature an India–Pakistan match. And this will open ground for ICC to take severe actions against Pakistan.Sources close to ICC had told HT that the decision to boycott the India game could directly reflect on their earnings from the tournament.“As a direct consequence, PCB’s share of ICC annual revenue [estimated at around $34.5 million], would be withheld,” an official had said.India vs Pakistan Controversy: A TimelineRelations between the PCB and BCCI have been strained for a long time. Things escalated last year after India refused to travel to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025. Matters worsened during the Asia Cup 2025, when Indian players declined to shake hands with Pakistan in the aftermath of the terror attack in Pahalgam.advertisementThe situation intensified after Bangladesh wrote to the ICC, stating that it would not travel to India due to alleged security concerns. Reports from Pakistan suggested that the PCB reached out to the BCB, offering to host Bangladesh’s matches instead. However, the ICC put a cap on that matter, dismissing Bangladesh's request.The PCB also attempted to pressure the ICC and BCCI by withholding confirmation of its travel plans until February 1, setting the stage for the standoff that has now spilt into the T20 World Cup.- EndsPublished By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Feb 1, 2026Tune InAlso Read | Ishan Kishan grabs the Tatkal ticket.

This could lead to serious financial challenges amid ongoing stadium upgrades and revenue dependencies.AdvertisementAkhtar told Pakistan to target getting wickets in the final (Courtesy: AP)Press Trust of IndiaNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 4, 2026 21:40 ISTThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) could face massive financial losses if the ICC's all-powerful governing board decides to penalise them for refusing to play the T20 World Cup match against India on February 15 in Colombo.According to details collected by PTI, Pakistan's share in the ICC's financial cycle 2024/27 comes to approximately USD 144 million at the highest pay out rate of USD 38 million distributed to the PCB annually.advertisement"Basically if the ICC decides to penalise Pakistan for not playing India, the PCB could take a big hit financially as the ICC share in the current financial cycle comes to approximately 40 billion PKR," an insider said. He said that these 40 billion rupees have enabled the PCB to remain financially healthy, but if they take a hit, it will mean financial challenges for Pakistan cricket.He confirmed that Pakistan had already received substantial shares from the ICC for the 2024 T20 World Cup and last year's Champions Trophy, which it also hosted and got an additional USD 6 million from a total budget of USD 70 million for the tournament.The insider said the PCB had spent a lot on organising the event and in terms of gate money, sale of hospitality boxes didn't earn much.Pakistan, though, were able to play just one match at home as their clash against India was held at a neutral venue in Dubai as per an agreement signed between the BCCI, PCB and ICC.The PCB spent around 18 billion rupees on upgradation work at three stadiums in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi, which are still ongoing, and this has also affected the board's earnings from the Champions Trophy."The PCB is yet to get shares from the T20 World Cup this year and from the 50-over World Cup next year and that is where the ICC could impose financial penalties," he said.He also explained that since the PCB was a signatory to the participating teams agreement for the ICC events, in case there is no ground for force majeure the ICC and the broadcasters could push for heavy financial penalties on the PCB while seeking compensation.He said according to a rough estimate the broadcasters, who paid USD 3 billion to the ICC for the current financial cycle, depend heavily on the Pakistan-India matches to make profits or break even as each game between the two countries is estimated to earn them around USD 250,000 million or more.In four ICC events this cycle, broadcasters are guaranteed USD one billion from four Pakistan-India matches. And if they are not held, it will lead to a substantial reduction in the shares distributed to member countries.advertisementThe PCB's other main sources of revenues on surface include USD 42 million as franchise fees starting from the PSL 11th edition this year with the addition of two new teams.The two new teams were sold for 175,000 crore (estimated USD 6.2 million) and 185,000 crores (estimated USD 6.65 million) while after revaluation of the existing five out of six franchises, the PCB will now earn around USD 20 million from them as annual fees.The PCB will also be auctioning off the Multan Sultans franchise this month and going by the trend set in the auction of the new Hyderabad and Sialkot teams, it could sell off the Multan franchise for around 200 crore which comes to approximately USD 7 million included in the total annual franchise fees of around USD 42 million.The PCB at the same time distributes 95 percent of the central pool revenues of the PSL from sale of media broadcasting rights, title sponsorships and advertising and franchises also get 90 percent of the total gate revenues from the league.advertisementThe insider said the PCB revenues also include money from the national team's sponsorship deal and sale of the national team's home international and domestic cricket rights."But the PCB also has huge expenses which include subsidising the domestic events, salaries and administration expenses, perks for around 700 to 800 employees," he said.He also reminded that a 2023 audit report by the auditor general of Pakistan pointed out problems in receiving the annual franchise fees and absence of bank guarantees in some cases.The audit report also forecast substantial potential loss of 10.751 million rupees for the board from the 7th to 12th edition but this was before the two new teams fetched the board 360 crore rupees.Other major expenses for the PCB include approximately USD 5 to 6 million on paying the contractual players monthly retainers.Since 2023, the PCB has not bothered to post any annual audited financial report on its website as is the practice across the world.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Amar PanickerPublished On: Feb 4, 2026Read More: | U19 World Cup: George 115 helps India chase record 311 vs Afghanistan to reach finalMust Watch Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchIndia protected agriculture, dairy interests in US trade deal: Piyush Goyal2 Jaish terrorists killed as security forces blow up cave in Jammu and KashmirRahul Gandhi Calls Ravneet Singh Bittu a 'Traitor' outside ParliamentAdvertisementRead ThisPCB face heavy financial losses if they refuse to play India at T20 World Cup: ReportWashington Post to lay off 1-3rd staff after Trump's federal workforce cutbacks' coverageIND-PAK match can happen if Bangladesh are reinstated at T20 World Cup: Ex-PCB chiefTRENDING TOPICST20 World CupT20 World Cup ScheduleT20 World Cup Points TableAdvertisement

This time, the target was not a player or an administrator, but a veteran journalist who asked a couple of inconvenient questions. So, at India Today, we tried to figure out: Has India's cricket discourse gone down the drain?AdvertisementSharda Ugra was abused online for her interview on The Wire. (Photo: India Today)Kingshuk KusariNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 8, 2026 11:12 ISTAbout a week before the T20 World Cup, Sharda Ugra woke up to a wave of criticism. Her lack of presence on social media meant that she was largely unaware of what was unfolding, but a flurry of messages from friends and colleagues ensured that she quickly grasped the scale of the reaction to her interview with The Wire.The interview, conducted by Karan Thapar, did not sit well with a large section of Indian cricket fans. In it, Ugra criticised the Board of Control for Cricket in India for politicising the sport. She also took aim at the Pakistan Cricket Board for repeatedly attempting to extract mileage from controversy, and at the International Cricket Council for not doing anything about it.advertisement By the morning of January 28, Sharda Ugra — a journalist with over three decades of experience — had been turned into a problem for India’s majoritarian cricket crowd. The criticism ranged from challenges to her professional credentials to deeply personal and abusive attacks. Ugra, however, remained unmoved.“I have zero digital footprint, and I had no idea what was going on. My friends were messaging me frantically, asking if I was okay. That’s how I found out. But it didn’t make me feel bad. Honestly, I wasn’t surprised. This tends to happen whenever I write or say something that doesn’t align with popular opinion,” Ugra told India Today.“I was deeply moved by the support I received — from people I know and people I don’t, from all over the world. That was beautiful,” she added.The nature of the criticism directed at Ugra underlined a deeper malaise in India’s cricket ecosystem. Was disagreement no longer possible without hostility? Had character assassination become the default mode of engagement on social media?‘SOCIAL MEDIA IS TOILET OF THE INTERNET’India Today Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai sees this as part of a larger pattern. For him, the vilification of individuals is a political habit that has seeped into other spheres, including sport. A generation that has grown up watching public figures being delegitimised through sustained online attacks may now see personal abuse not as an aberration, but as a legitimate — even fashionable — form of expression.“Like politics, sports opinion too is becoming worryingly polarised. And the politicisation of sport has made the discourse more shrill, more aggressive, and far more shallow,” Sardesai said over the phone.POLARISATION SELLSThe Sharda Ugra episode echoes Lady Gaga’s famous line: Social media is the toilet of the internet. It is difficult to argue otherwise.Indian cricket discourse has increasingly become a battlefield of fandoms. Divisiveness sells, and platforms reward it. Beyond India vs Pakistan or East Bengal vs Mohun Bagan, even players from the same team are pitted against one another. Virat Kohli fans clash with Rohit Sharma fans. Shubman Gill supporters sneer at Rishabh Pant loyalists.advertisementIt may seem trivial, but the incentives make things clear: the more polarising the content, the greater the reach — and the more lucrative the ecosystem becomes.In Ugra’s case, some accused her of being a “Pakistan agent” — a claim so absurd that, if voiced in a family WhatsApp group, would likely be met with a collective groan. But anonymity changes the rules. Without accountability, outrage becomes effortless.And women, inevitably, bear the worst of it.At the 2024 Paris Olympics, boxer Imane Khelif was subjected to a grotesque campaign of harassment. Morphed images circulated freely. Fake quotes were attributed to her. A section of the internet decided she was a man because she did not conform to a narrow, deeply patriarchal idea of what a woman should look like. Imane Khelif was harassed on social media for her appearance. advertisementMore recently, the influence of Andrew Tate has demonstrated how algorithm-driven platforms can amplify misogyny at scale. A convicted criminal, Tate has built an “alpha male” mythology around himself, one that reduces women to objects and hostility to virtue. Social media platforms elevate his content because outrage performs — and performance translates into profit.Tate says something inflammatory. It goes viral. Podcasts invite him on for clout. He launches courses and shows, which in turn create more content, feeding the same cycle.“I think social media gives people a licence to put out ill-tempered and vile observations,” Ugra said. “It has given people power without consequences.”Andrew Tate, who is lauded by many as the most masculine heterosexual alpha male confirms that he would have sex with a beautiful transsexual. pic.twitter.com/jGnvpVXnAS— aimee (@basic_chanel) March 7, 2023This is not to suggest that civil discourse is impossible. During the Women’s Premier League in 2026, widespread support emerged for Lizelle Lee when she was fat-shamed online. The response included criticism, yes, but also thoughtful discussion about fitness, performance and unrealistic standards imposed on athletes.The real fracture does not lie in disagreement itself, but in the normalisation of offensive and hateful speech — often legitimised by those in positions of power. Social media accelerates this process, teaching users that those who disagree are not merely wrong, but undeserving of engagement.advertisementOnce that line is crossed, conversation collapses.BUT WHO BENEFITS FROM POLARISATION?With the commodification of outrage, sporting discourse in India — and elsewhere — has grown steadily more polarised. When India play Pakistan, advertisements routinely demean the opposition. The same rhetoric, perhaps, exists across the border. Against Australia, the narrative shifts to revenge, conquest and lion vs kangaroo metaphors.Polarisation has become embedded in the spectacle itself.But who benefits from it?“The polarisation serves a purpose for those who use cricket and the BCCI to project a certain image,” Ugra said. “You see it constantly in broadcast advertising. Unyielding nationalism, belittling rivals, humiliating them — it began lightly and humorously, but it has grown far more toxic, particularly with reference to Pakistan.”The BCCI would rather not show Indian and Pakistani fans dancing together to the tunes of Pasoori in the stands, but it will repeatedly replay footage of jeering crowds.“It has now become a battle between governments. That’s what it serves. It insults fans and belittles the game. There is no space left for joy or banter,” Ugra added.advertisementCricket boards increasingly function as extensions of the state. The BCCI mirrors the Indian government, just as the PCB reflects Pakistan’s and the BCB Bangladesh’s.If cricket boards had focused purely on the sport, Mustafizur Rahman would not have become a soft target in the IPL. Bangladesh would not have withdrawn from the T20 World Cup, and Pakistan would have addressed its broken cricketing structure instead of outsourcing blame.Instead, cricket has been pulled into a geopolitical trifecta that has pushed the game itself to the margins.And who benefits? PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi, reportedly harbouring ambitions of becoming the Prime Minister of Pakistan. A majoritarian Indian government keen to project strength. Bangladeshi leaders, who are more invested in stoking anti-India sentiment than in repairing domestic failures.“The brand of nationalism that demands constant hostility towards rivals shows how narrow we have become,” said Sundeep Misra, Editor of the NNIS. “There is an army of people willing to spew outrage. This has been engineered.”They are politicians, after all.WHY JOURNALISTS ARE NOT CHEERLEADERSThat this culture is entrenched became evident on January 28, when a largely Gen Z online audience turned on Sharda Ugra. One Instagram reel accused her of hypocrisy for criticising the BCCI alone. The implication was familiar: critique is invalid unless evenly distributed, that power can only be questioned if all power is questioned simultaneously.This reflex — why this and not that — is not an invitation to broaden conversation. It is a mechanism designed to shut it down. Instead of engaging with substance, motives are interrogated, credibility is challenged, and intent is questioned. The original argument disappears.One X account even demanded to know who Ugra was, and what she had achieved.A simple Google search would have enlightened that silly troll. Sharda Ugra is 57. More than 30 years of which she has watched and reported on Indian sports. She is not just any journalist. She is one of the finest writers and the most respected journalists in the profession. That's who Sharda Ugra is.The problem is not Gen Z’s passion. That has always existed in sport. The problem is the belief that journalists are cheerleaders — that their role is to amplify national sentiment, not interrogate power.What is being missed is that critique is not betrayal. Questioning institutions is not disloyalty. Disagreement, when done honestly, is not violence. Journalism, especially in sport, has never been about picking sides; it has been about asking why sides exist in the first place.And yet, despite the vitriol, Ugra refuses to write Gen Z off.“When you write this, give Gen Z my love. I hope they figure things out at their own pace. That life is more gentle with them. Try to be kind, try to be happy — that’s all,” she said.As Sharda Ugra signed off, she reminds that sport remains one of the few social inventions capable of collapsing borders, languages and identities into a common emotion. That is precisely why those who profit from division are invested in fracturing it. And that is why we cannot let them get away with it.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Feb 8, 2026Also Read | Italy police fire tear gas, water cannon to break Winter Olympics protestMust Watch IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchVideo: Terrifying moment when 'tsunami' swing snaps mid-air, crashes to groundUS trade deal shows India’s confidence, not compromise: Piyush GoyalTime doesn't heal anything, it gives you strength to carry weight: Usha UthupAdvertisementRead ThisFarmers' interests protected: Shivraj Chouhan welcomes India-US trade dealIndia's new eyes can track, and image enemy satellites in real timeAfter spending time with EVs, it changed my driving style and perceptionTRENDING TOPICST20 World CupT20 World Cup ScheduleT20 World Cup Points TableAdvertisement

Courtesy: APSabyasachi ChowdhuryNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 8, 2026 14:56 ISTNew Zealand passed Afghanistan’s spin test with flying colours to open their T20 World Cup campaign in impressive style. On Sunday at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, the Black Caps registered a composed five-wicket victory, underlining that their batters are more than capable of wearing down a high-quality spin attack.Afghanistan tried hard to put New Zealand under sustained pressure, but the Kiwis absorbed the challenge calmly and ensured they came through the storm to finish on the winning side. Tim Seifert played a pivotal role with a timely half-century as the Kiwis chased down 183 with 13 balls to spare.advertisementT20 World Cup, Afghanistan vs New Zealand Highlights Just as importantly, New Zealand made sure there was no repeat of the painful memory from the 2024 T20 World Cup, when Afghanistan hammered them by 84 runs after bowling them out for 75 while defending 160. This time, the script was firmly rewritten.In the process, the Black Caps also recorded their highest successful run chase in men’s T20 World Cup history, surpassing their previous best of 167 against England in the 2021 semi-final at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi. GULBADIN GUIDES AFGHANISTANAfter opting to bat first, Afghanistan made a scratchy start as openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran took time to settle. Gurbaz was handed an early lifeline on seven when Finn Allen and Tim Seifert collided while attempting a catch after a mistimed pull shot.Just when it appeared that Gurbaz and Zadran would see out the powerplay unscathed, Lockie Ferguson changed the momentum. He removed Gurbaz for 27 with the first ball he faced, before also getting the better of Ibrahim, who could manage only 10 off 12 deliveries.From there, Gulbadin Naib and Sediqullah Atal steadied the innings with a crucial 79-run partnership for the third wicket. Naib absorbed the pressure early, batting with caution before accelerating, while Atal played the supporting role effectively. Jacob Duffy eventually broke the stand, dismissing Atal for 29.Naib, however, carried on to provide the late impetus, bringing up a brisk half-century off 29 balls. His attacking 63 off 35 balls, featuring three fours and four sixes, anchored Afghanistan’s push to a competitive 182 for six. Useful cameos from Darwish Rasooli, Azmatullah Omarzai and Mohammad Nabi ensured Naib’s efforts were well supported. SEIFERT TAKES CHARGE FOR KIWISNew Zealand got off to a flying start in their run chase as Tim Seifert took Fazalhaq Farooqi apart, smashing three fours in the very first over. However, the momentum briefly swung Afghanistan’s way in the second over when Mujeeb Ur Rahman breathed fire.advertisementThe off-spinner removed Finn Allen and then sent Rachin Ravindra back for a golden duck, jolting the Kiwis early. Seifert and Glenn Phillips responded with composure, ensuring no further damage as New Zealand made full use of the powerplay to reach 52.Seifert then played the stabilising role that Gulbadin Naib had earlier performed for Afghanistan, anchoring the innings through a tense phase. He brought up his half-century off 39 balls and added a crucial 74-run stand with Phillips.Just as the pair threatened to take the game away, Rashid Khan intervened. Though Phillips took him on initially, Rashid had the last laugh, dismissing the aggressive batter.Mohammad Nabi then removed Phillips, who scored 42 off 25 balls with seven fours and a six, giving Afghanistan renewed hope. Seifert carried on until the 13th over before falling for a well-made 65 off 42, by which time New Zealand were firmly in control, needing 59 off 43 balls with six wickets in hand.Mark Chapman chipped in with a brisk 28, before Daryl Mitchell’s unbeaten 25 and Mitchell Santner’s 17 guided the Kiwis home in 17.5 overs.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Feb 8, 2026Must Watch Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchVideo: Terrifying moment when 'tsunami' swing snaps mid-air, crashes to groundUS trade deal shows India’s confidence, not compromise: Piyush GoyalTime doesn't heal anything, it gives you strength to carry weight: Usha UthupAdvertisementRead ThisLodhi Art Festival unfolds: Public art learns to live with the cityOn camera, 'drunk' Bengaluru women assault cab driver, abuse crowd after spat2 arrested in deadly Surajkund joyride accident, cops probe negligenceTRENDING TOPICST20 World CupT20 World Cup ScheduleT20 World Cup Points TableAdvertisement

He warned that early collapses and sloppy powerplays could hurt India against stronger teams.AdvertisementAbhishek Sharma was dismissed for a golden duck vs USA. (Photo: Getty, AP)India Today Sports DeskMumbai,UPDATED: Feb 8, 2026 08:41 ISTWritten By: Debodinna ChakrabortyIndia began their T20 World Cup campaign with a win, but the opening-night thriller against the USA came with a few loud lessons. Sunil Gavaskar believes the narrow escape should serve as an early wake-up call, especially with bigger tests looming.The former India captain pointed out that while India eventually defended 161 comfortably, the top-order collapse and early jitters showed why no team can afford complacency in a World Cup. Speaking on Star Sports, Gavaskar stressed that India must be sharper with their batting plans even with their depth.advertisementIND vs USA T20 World Cup: Updates | Scorecard “I think 160 wouldn’t have been easy. They defended eventually by a margin of 30 runs, which is a very good margin. So there is plenty to learn — plenty to learn that yes, there is batting depth.”“But if you’ve got eight batters, and then 9, 10, 11 are your bowlers, and out of those eight batters you lose four wickets in the first 7-8 overs, then you are going to be in trouble — against better teams, against teams who have a lot more experience of playing in World Cups and a lot more experience of T20 cricket.”Gavaskar’s larger point was simple: batting depth is useful, but it cannot become an excuse for reckless powerplay damage. Against more seasoned opponents, early collapses can cost them dearly as they move further into the tournament.“Yes, there is a powerplay of six overs, but you don’t want to lose four wickets in that powerplay because that way you are putting yourself in a spot of bother.”“What we must all remember is that when it comes to world events, every team raises the level of its performance, because world events don’t come every day.”What happened in IND vs USA?India, hailed as clear favourites not just for the match but for the tournament, were pushed into uncomfortable territory early. Their batting, one of their biggest strengths in recent years, suffered a major letdown as wickets kept tumbling.At one stage, India were reeling at 77/6 in 12.4 overs, staring at the prospect of a below-par total in their opening fixture. The pressure was unfamiliar, and the USA’s energy in the field only added to the squeeze.That’s when skipper Suryakumar Yadav produced a captain’s rescue act. He struck an unbeaten 84 off 49 balls, smashing ten fours and four sixes, to lift India to 161/9 — a total that felt par after the collapse made even 140 seem difficult.How India bowlers rose to the occasionIndia’s bowlers ensured Suryakumar’s effort did not go unrewarded. Mohammad Siraj struck early with 2/29, Axar Patel tightened the screws through the middle with 2/24, and Arshdeep Singh held his nerve at the death with 2/18 as the USA were restricted to 132/8.advertisementThe 30-run margin looked comfortable in the end, but Gavaskar underlined that World Cup games are rarely straightforward, especially when every opponent lifts their intensity.Even Suryakumar admitted India could not simply move on without addressing the batting issues.“We cannot brush everything under the carpet, we need to bat much better. After winning also, you get to learn a lot of things. Could have batted better and smarter,” the skipper said at the post-match presentation.India have the points on the board, but the opening game offered a timely reminder of the margins in a World Cup. Against the USA, India needed Suryakumar’s rescue act and a disciplined bowling effort to steady a match that should have been more straightforward.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Feb 8, 2026IN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchVideo: Terrifying moment when 'tsunami' swing snaps mid-air, crashes to groundUS trade deal shows India’s confidence, not compromise: Piyush GoyalTime doesn't heal anything, it gives you strength to carry weight: Usha UthupAdvertisementRead ThisUSA thriller exposed key T20 World Cup lessons for India: Gavaskar lists solutionsFees vs ROI: Where an MBA truly pays offRussian college stabbing: Teen attacker was a neo-Nazi, painted swastika on wallTRENDING TOPICST20 World CupT20 World Cup ScheduleT20 World Cup Points TableAdvertisement

Then came Suryakumar Yadav's call 24 hours before the World Cup opener. The pacer delivered three wickets on his dramatic return.AdvertisementMohammad Siraj made his return to the T20I side after 18 months. (Image: AP)India Today Sports DeskMumbai,UPDATED: Feb 8, 2026 02:30 ISTWritten By: Amar Sunil PanickerMohammed Siraj had his February mapped out perfectly. A Real Madrid match on the 15th at the Santiago Bernabeu, followed by preparations for Ramzan with his family. After leading Hyderabad in the Ranji Trophy, the pacer had earned some rest. The T20 World Cup seemed like a distant dream—one that belonged to someone else's destiny.IND vs USA T20 World Cup: Updates | ScorecardadvertisementBut destiny, as Siraj would soon discover, had other plans. In the space of 24 hours, everything changed. The Bernabeu would have to wait. India was calling. From Bernabeu to Wankhede in 24 hoursJust a day before India's T20 World Cup opener against the USA, Siraj was at home in Hyderabad, miles away from any World Cup dream. For the past 18 months, he had watched from the sidelines as India groomed their T20 squad for the tournament. When he wasn't selected for the bilateral T20 series, the message seemed clear—this World Cup wasn't meant for him."I never thought I would play in the World Cup," Siraj admitted candidly at the pre-match press conference. "When I didn't play in T20s, I understood that I wouldn't be part of it this year."Then came the messages. First, from Adrian le Roux, India's support staff, asking about his plans. Siraj's response was blunt: "Don't message me right now—I'm resting because I'm playing two four-day games."But fate intervened when Harshit Rana picked up a knee injury during India's warm-up match against South Africa. The selectors needed a replacement quickly, and they turned to a familiar face—someone who had already been part of India's victorious T20 World Cup 2024 campaign. What happened next changed Siraj's entire February calendar.'Surya bhai, don't joke'Minutes later, his phone rang. Captain Suryakumar Yadav was on the line."Get ready, pack your bag, and come," Surya told him.Siraj's first instinct? Disbelief. "Surya bhai, don't joke, because this is not going to happen," he replied, convinced his captain was pulling his leg.But Surya wasn't joking. Before Siraj could process the conversation, another call came through—this time from the team management. The shocking news was confirmed. He was flying to Mumbai. The Real Madrid match, the family time, the Ramzan preparations—all would have to be rescheduled."My plan was that on the 15th, there was a Real Madrid match, and I was going to watch it," Siraj revealed. "But whatever God has written will happen."From flight to fight modeadvertisementTwenty-four hours is hardly enough time to shift from domestic cricket captain to World Cup warrior, but Siraj had a decade of international experience to lean on. As he sat on the flight to Mumbai—heading to the Wankhede instead of the Bernabeu—the surreal nature of it all hit him."When I was sitting on the flight, it felt like a dream," he said.But dreams require execution, and Siraj knew exactly what he needed to do. There was no time for elaborate preparations or tactical overhauls. His approach was simple: trust what had worked."I just bowled the same line and length that I was bowling in the Ranji Trophy," Siraj explained. "My plan was to stick to the new ball, bowl wicket to wicket, and if I could get a wicket there, it would help the team a lot."Delivering when it matteredThe plan worked to perfection. Siraj's three-wicket haul against the USA was instrumental in India's opening victory, justifying the selectors' faith and vindicated his own belief in his methods. Even the night before the match, as he tried to sleep in unfamiliar surroundings, his mindset remained clear."I just thought I would stick to the same weapon that has given me success so far," he said. "And I got the same success today as well."advertisementWhat made the performance even more remarkable was the context. India had slumped to 77 for 6 before captain Suryakumar Yadav's heroic 84 not out dragged them to a competitive 161 for 9. Siraj's early wickets with the new ball then set the tone for India's defence, helping secure a crucial World Cup victory.God changed my destinyFor a man who never expected to be part of this World Cup, Mohammed Siraj's journey from family time to the flight that felt like a dream perfectly encapsulates the beautiful unpredictability of cricket."No one can change what God has written," Siraj reflected, his voice carrying the weight of someone still processing his fortune. "I came, played the match—everything was written."Real Madrid's loss was India's gain. And whilst the Bernabeu will still be there for another day, this World Cup moment—arriving 24 hours before kickoff and delivering when it mattered most—will stay with Siraj forever.T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Schedule | T20 World Cup Points Table | T20 World Cup Videos | Cricket News | Live Score- EndsPublished By: Amar PanickerPublished On: Feb 8, 2026Read More: | T20 World Cup: Suryakumar Yadav special helps India avoid opening-day gloom vs USAIN THIS STORY#T20 World CupWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchVideo: Terrifying moment when 'tsunami' swing snaps mid-air, crashes to groundUS trade deal shows India’s confidence, not compromise: Piyush GoyalTime doesn't heal anything, it gives you strength to carry weight: Usha UthupAdvertisementRead ThisHow Siraj cancelled plans to watch Real Madrid after shock T20 World Cup call-upHigh Court acquits constable in 30-year RS 20 bribe case, he dies next dayTejashwi Yadav takes charge as RJD working president, lays grassroots roadmapTRENDING TOPICST20 World CupT20 World Cup ScheduleT20 World Cup Points TableAdvertisement

The Wankhede Stadium echoed with belief as Nepal fans packed the stands, cheering relentlessly and riding every twist of emotion. For a few thrilling moments, history seemed within reach. But Sam Curran held his nerve, breaking Nepali hearts as England survived a massive scare to clinch a four-run win in the T20 World Cup clash on Sunday in Mumbai.advertisementThe performance marked a significant step forward for Nepal on the global stage. After memorable wins over Hong Kong and Afghanistan in 2014, they endured a winless campaign in 2024. This time, chasing a stiff 184-run target, Nepal gave themselves a realistic chance deep into the contest before eventually running out of steam.Despite the defeat, the mood was one of pride. Fans showered Nepal with praise for their courage, composure and fighting spirit, underlining a team that continues to grow in belief and ambition. Fans asked Nepal to hold their heads high for giving the 2022 champions a run for their money.

We could have had as many as 6 upsets. That's right. Nearly every match could have had a different script. But a pattern seems to be emerging - the 'minnows' or the lower-ranked teams seem to be struggling to wrap up games and that's where they are getting hurt. From that point of view, Monday, 9th February, 2026 does not have the firepower of teams playing as compared to the weekend. It is still a triple-header day, with newcomers Italy meeting Scotland at 5.30 am GMT at the Eden Gardens, followed by the Oman-Zimbabwe clash at 9.30 am GMT in Colombo (at a different venue, SSC) and then finally, rounding off with South Africa taking on Canada at 1.30 pm GMT in Ahmedabad. There might not be players with big names but with how the World Cup has started off so far, don't be surprised if we see something new in the making. The timings mentioned are the ones when the first ball will be bowled but our buildup will begin well in advance. So do tune in early. ADIOS! TAKE CARE!23:13 IST:So Sri Lanka get away with a win and have 3 days to analyze Wanindu Hasaranga's injury. They play Oman next, on Thursday, 12th February, 2026 in Pallekele, but if truth be told, they might rest him for that clash to make him fit and available for the match against Australia on 16th February, 2026. As far as Ireland are concerned, they meet Australia next, on Wednesday, 11th February, 2026. That match is at this same venue, so they will certainly have a better knowledge of the conditions as compared to the Aussies. Mind you, Australia's only warm-up game was washed out in Colombo. The Irish will hope to do better in that match and more importantly, finish the job.23:08 IST:DASUN SHANAKA, the victorious skipper of Sri Lanka, says that he is happy with the all round performance tonight. Adds that they didn't start off well with the bat but Kusal Mendis held up one end well and the cameo from Kamindu Mendis was like he was batting on a different wicket. Feels that he initially thought the wicket would be a bit flatter but it did help them as well as it slowed down in the second innings. Mentions that the confidence in the bowling unit carries on from the previous match and hopefully, Wanindu Hasaranga's hamstring is fine.23:18 IST:The captain of Ireland, PAUL STIRLING, comes up for a chat. On being asked to sum up the match, Stirling feels that Sri Lanka got 15-20 runs too many. Adds that at the start of the day, Ireland would have been happy to chase down somewhere around 160. He adds that the momentum shuft in the back end of the first innings hurt his side badly. On being asked as to where did the game change, Paul replies that when the match was on the line, his side wasn't as clinical as it wanted to be. But stresses that they have got a couple of days to reflect and come back stronger and sharper. Believes that the Irish had the Lankan team on the mat in both innings but those 20 runs in the end was the key.23:05 IST:Player Of The Match - For his quickfire 44 (19), Sri Lanka's KAMINDU MENDIS has been adjudged the Player Of The Match. Kamindu says that when he came out to bat, he wanted to keep the momentum up and built a good partnership with Kusal Mendis. Adds that Ireland played well till the 15-16th over but the bowlers came back strongly, used the change of pace and kept them under 150. Feels that it was a 170-wicket but after playing the spinners for a while, they knew 160 could be a defendable total. Ends by saying that the spirits are good in the camp and they are looking forward to the rest of the tournament.23:04 IST:... THE PRESENTATION ...23:04 IST:Lucky escape or a champion display? Depends on how you see a glass with water filled upto half level. Half full, or half empty? Clearly, this was not the best match for the Lankans by any means but the key thing was they found a way to fight. For some reason, they stopped showing intent with the bat post the 6th over but then played tremendously in the last 4 overs. With the ball, they were searching for that third breakthrough and once they got it, they just ran through the opposition. Sure, they can consider themselves lucky that Ireland dropped so many catches, but all these are a part and parcel of the game. Please stay tuned for the presentation.22:59 IST:Positives for Ireland - They did well for nearly 70 percent of both innings on an average. The bowlers set things up nicely, and then, the batters laid the platform decently. George Dockrell was outstanding, with bowling figures of 2/17 in 4 overs, while with the bat, Ross Adair and Harry Tector impressed everyone with their running. But their inability to close things out with both innings hurt them. But they will take confidence from this display for the matches to come.22:55 IST:A game of missed opportunities - Ireland had their chances. And a lot of them. First, with the ball. They had the Lankans on the mat at 104/4 after 16 overs. Suddenly, catches started getting dropped left, right and centre. Then, with the bat, they had created a wonderful platform - 105/2, needing 59 runs from 35 balls. But then, they just started losing wickets left, right and centre.22:53 IST:A win is a win - That's what the Lankans would say. This is a World Cup and every opposition can be dangerous. They will introspect of course, be it their shoddy batting or indisciplined bowling in the first half of both innings. But they will revel on the fact that with their backs against the wall, they found heroes across both innings - the two Mendises with the bat and Wanindu Hasaranga with one leg. Of course, Theekshana bowled well too.22:51 IST:Nervy win! Relief for Sri Lanka. They are not looking overly pleased or even happy and in fact, this seems like a normal day at work where things could have gone really out of hand. With due respect to Ireland, they played out of their skins with both bat and ball and a critic will feel that they have let things slip by here.22:53 IST:19.5: Matheesha Pathirana to Matthew Humphreys, OUT! BOWLED! Bulls' eye from Pathirana. He keeps it straight, on a length, outside off, getting it to angle in. Humphreys swings hard but misses. The ball cannons into the off stump and SRI LANKA WIN BY 20 RUNS!22:48 IST:19.4: Matheesha Pathirana to Matthew Humphreys, A slower ball, on a length, outside off, Matthew Humphreys swings hard and gets a bottom edge. It goes on the bounce to the keeper.22:48 IST:Number 11 does come out to bat then. Matthew Humphreys would not have expected that in the 15th over.22:47 IST:19.3: Matheesha Pathirana to George Dockrell, OUT! CAUGHT! Timed well by George Dockrell but just not well enough. Matheesha Pathirana takes pace off and bowls it wide outside off. Dockrell hangs deep in the crease and reaches out to slash it over cover-point. Dockrell ends up hitting it straight down the throat of Kamindu Mendis at sweeper cover and he makes no mistake. Ireland are now 9 down for 143.22:46 IST:19.2: Matheesha Pathirana to George Dockrell, FOUR! Oh, that's gone past everyone. Full-length and around off, Dockrell hits it straight back. The fielder at mid off is a bit sluggish and the ball goes past him and again, it is Kamil Mishara at long on who runs to his left. He puts in the dive but this time, the ball wins the race.22:45 IST:19.1: Matheesha Pathirana to George Dockrell, A yorker, aimed in at the toes but angling down leg. Dockrell backs away and jamsit out through in front of square leg for a couple of runs.22:45 IST:The final over then. Ireland need 27 runs. By the way, the wicket of Curtis Campher picked up by Wanindu Hasaranga was his 40th in T20 World Cups, second only to Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan, who has scalped 50.

Dasun Shanaka got across to his left from long off and got to the ball pretty easily. Adair departs for 10 (6) and from 105/2, Ireland are now 137/8!

With the net run rate in question, Ireland should aim to play out 20 overs and get as close to 150 as possible, to reduce the defeat margin. Mark Adair walks in next, at number 9, replacing Curtis Campher.22:36 IST:17.4: Wanindu Hasaranga to Curtis Campher, OUT! CAUGHT! And the one-legged warrior gets his third! Tossed up, outside off, Curtis Campher comes down the track and looks to go over the top. Is barely to the pitch of the ball and only hits it straight to long off, where Dasun Shanaka makes no mistake. Campher departs for 13 (11) and from 105/2, Ireland are now 126/7!

Curtis Campher gets across, sits down and slogs it against the turn. The square boundary on the leg side is a big one and he gets it to the right of deep mid-wicket. Pavan Rathnayake smartly runs around and palms the ball in. Just another brace.22:37 IST:17.2: Wanindu Hasaranga to Curtis Campher, Brilliant fielding in the deep.

Ben Calitz looked like a prime candidate for a stumping or bowled and he has to walk back here. Smartly bowled by Maheesh Theekshana as he sees the batter advancing down the track and slows it up nicely. This is bowled on a dragged length as well and drifts away from middle and leg. Calitz goes through with the shot and misses it completely. The ball just beats the off stump and Kusal Mendis is lightning quick to complete the stumping with Calitz well out of his crease.

We were getting the feeling that the batters were tiring and with the required rate touching 10 per over, they decided to go for the big hits. That meant more power, through a tired body. Wellalage drops it short, around middle, cramping the batter for room and Lorcan Tucker goes for the pull. But there is a power failure and he finds Kamil Mishara at long on. The 49-run stand is broken and Tucker departs for 21 (18).

Well, this is baffling. Just an over ago, the players had an unofficial drinks break. And now, they are taking another. By T20 standards, 60 from 36 seems doable. But the heat is getting to the batters and with all the running, they are getting tired even more. Because of the long boundaries, they are not able to score fours and sixes with consistency.

Pinpoint start by Chameera.21:13 IST:Amar Panicker saysSL vs IRE: Classy Chameera gets goingThe first over of the second innings was a masterclass from the fast bowler—a perfect template for how to start an innings and immediately set the tone. The change-ups were executed beautifully, getting into the batter's head with clever variations. Mixing pace with the occasional slower delivery kept the batter guessing throughout, and despite all that pressure, they only managed to sneak away a single boundary. Clinical stuff. 21:08 IST:0.5: Dushmantha Chameera to Ross Adair, On a length, around off, skids through, 139.3 kph, Ross Adair is surprised and late in bringing his bat down.

Stirling will be on strike, just one slip in place. Let's go...21:01 IST:... The Run Chase ...20:59 IST:Runs on the board for the win?Looking at the scoreboard, 164 seems to a relatively easy chase for Ireland but sometimes numbers lie. We saw how the Irish spinners had a stranglehold on the hosts in the middle phase. Sri Lanka will be looking to do the same and pick up their first win in front of a buoyant home crowd. Can Ireland silence the home crowd? Only time will tell. The run chase is up next.21:00 IST:Getting out of jail - Sri Lanka will thank their lucky stars a bit as that wasn't what they would have wanted with the bat. The top order crumbled after a relatively fast start and Kusal Mendis was left stranded at one end. He tried to up the ante but it just wasn't happening for him in the middle phase. Kamindu Mendis then came out to bat with the score being 86/4 in 13.5 overs. After a patchy start, he decided to open the floodgates in the 17th over. Kusal and Kamindu both kept going for it and got away with a few missed catches but the latter did fall for a quickfire 44 off just 19 balls as Kusal ended up scoring a fighting and unbeaten 56 off 43 balls.20:57 IST:Letting the Lankans off the hook - After what was a very even-stevens Powerplay, the Irish bowlers did brilliantly to squeeze things in the middle phase. For almost 10 overs, they didn't even concede a boundary as George Dockrell (4-0-17-2) bowled a stellar spell that got Ireland out in front. The last 4 overs were a different story altogether as the boundaries kept flowing, the catches kept going down, and the extras started to build up. They did get a couple of wickets at the death but Kamindu Mendis had already done the damage by then.20:54 IST:Blockbuster entertainment - Now that was an innings that had everything in it - some great and disciplined bowling from Ireland, a bit of sluggish cricket from both sides, and then that fiery finish from Sri Lanka with the bat. At the end of the first 20 overs, the hosts might feel they have the edge in this one, especially with their spin attack. However, Ireland will believe they are very much in it as the score on the board is a middling one.Score 163/6BatsmanKusal Mendis 56(43b 5*4 0*6)BowlerMark Adair 4-0-33-120:53 IST:19.6: Mark Adair to Kusal Mendis, Another slower ball.

The fielder comes charging in but the ball lands well in front of him. The batters return for the second and SRI LANKA FINISH ON 163/6!20:56 IST:Amar Panicker saysInteresting end to the inningsInterestingly, Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga has wasted no time, heading straight out onto the field to work with the bowlers ahead of the second innings. Heading into the final stretch, Sri Lanka can count themselves fortunate given the number of extras they were gifted along the way. That said, Ireland have had their moments with the ball and showed real fight. Now it all comes down to whether they can translate that energy into a strong batting performance and pull off a win against the co-hosts. 20:52 IST:19.6: Mark Adair to Kusal Mendis, WIDE. We are still not done yet. Slower ball, into the surface, outside off, Kusal Mendis waits for the ball to arrive and then leaps to play the upper cut. Misses.

While they'll be pleased with the wickets, the runs leaked in that passage of play could prove costly. Barry McCarthy did well to pull things back with two quick strikes, but the damage may already be done. Meanwhile, Dasun Shanaka finds himself in unwanted territory after recording yet another duck. He now holds the dubious record for most ducks in T20 Internationals with 16 from 113 innings, surpassing Zappy Bimenyimana (15 from 62 innings) and Paul Stirling (14 from 158 innings).

The ball has been deemed legal and the Lankan skipper comes and goes for a golden duck. And yet another bowler is a on a hat-trick in this World Cup! And this has come out of nowhere. A high full toss, around middle, Dasun Shanaka looks to go big, aiming to swing it to the leg side but only gets a massive top edge. The ball goes high in the air, but only as far as short third. Mark Adair takes the catch but nearly makes a meal of it, taking it very low above the surface. Ireland start to celebrate but Shanaka looks at the umpires to question the height of the ball. The umpires refer it upstairs but technology projects the ball to be dipping onto the batter, meaning a fair ball.20:45 IST:A wicket! But is the ball legal? The third umpire has been called into action to check whether this was above the waist height or not.20:43 IST:The Lankan dugout will be breathing a lot easier now. 8 balls left and they can target 170, even 175 from here. Skipper Dasun Shanaka walks in next, at number 7, replacing Kamindu Mendis for a fiery finish.20:41 IST:18.4: Barry McCarthy to Kamindu Mendis, OUT! CAUGHT! Stop the press.

The batters take the single and Mendis turns blind for the second. However, Wellalage sends him back at the right time and Mendis dives back in, before the throw comes at the bowling end, with the stumps being dislodged.20:01 IST:12.3: George Dockrell to Dunith Wellalage, Short and outside off, Wellalage goes back and punches it through mid on for one.20:01 IST:12.2: George Dockrell to Kusal Mendis, Full and slightly wide outside off, Kusal Mendis reaches out and drives it through mid off for a run.20:00 IST:12.1: George Dockrell to Dunith Wellalage, Short, outside off, Dunith Wellalage cuts it behind point for a single.20:00 IST:The crowd is getting twitchy now. Cannot blame them. It is a Sunday evening and they have come here for entertainment. Additionally, the two games earlier today, in Chennai and Mumbai, were high-scoring thrillers. Of course, they will not mind if Sri Lanka win at the end of the day. Meanwhile, Wanindu Hasaranga is keenly watching from the Lankan dugout. Give me 140, he will be saying.

Where did Muralidaran come from, all of a sudden? Landed outside off, short of full, Kusal Mendis rocks back to dab it towards short third but the ball spins back in a long way, cramping him for room. Still, he manages to connect and gets a run in that region.19:55 IST:11.1: Harry Tector to Dunith Wellalage, Fired down the leg side, Dunith Wellalage clips it towards short fine leg for a single.19:55 IST:Time for a change in pace?

Dunith Wellalage walks in next, at number 5, replacing Pavan Rathnayake.19:50 IST:10.1: George Dockrell to Pavan Rathnayake, OUT! BOWLED! Rathnayake trying to be cute, ends up looking ugly. One feels that he tried 2-3 shots on that one ball. He backed away for probably playing the inside-out shot. Seeing that, Dockrell kept it full and in line of the stumps. So the response from the batter was to try the scoop past the keeper. If he had connected, it would have been a beautiful shot. But unfortunately, he missed and the ball hit the stumps. Dockrell is pumped up with his second scalp in 6 balls while Rathnayake is down on the ground. He departs for 5 (9) and from 62/1, Sri Lanka are now 68/3!20:55 IST:Halfway mark reached.

Ireland have been very ordinary in the field so far. Very full, outside off, Rathnayake eases the square drive through point. Sweeper gets across to his left but while picking up the ball, looks up early and lets the ball slip. Single was taken initially, but now gets doubled.19:47 IST:9.2: Gareth Delany to Kusal Mendis, Fuller, around middle, 86.4 kph, Kusal Mendis watchfully pushes it towards long on with a lunge, for a run.19:47 IST:9.1: Gareth Delany to Pavan Rathnayake, Tossed up, around leg stump, 89.5 kph, Pavan Rathnayake comes down the track, takes the ball on the full and pushes it towards long on for a single.Score 63/2BatsmanKusal Mendis 22(17b 3*4 0*6)BowlerGeorge Dockrell 2-0-6-119:45 IST:8.6: George Dockrell to Kusal Mendis, Full and around middle, 90.4 kph, Mendis defends.

The keeper appeals for LBW, more out of habit. That was hitting the 6th stump down the leg side.19:44 IST:8.3: George Dockrell to Pavan Rathnayake, Tossed up, outside off, Pavan Rathnayake comes forward and then goes back, to dab it towards backward point.19:43 IST:Despair for Nissanka. That was there for the taking. Pavan Rathnayake walks in next at number 4, replacing Pathum Nissanka.19:42 IST:8.2: George Dockrell to Pathum Nissanka, OUT! CAUGHT! Dockrell breaks the budding 34-run stand. Not by the best of deliveries though. Short and wide outside off, begging to be hit. Pathum Nissanka rocks back and slaps it away. But unfortunately for him, it goes straight into the bread basket of Paul Stirling at cover! Nissanka hangs his head back in disappointment. Just a metre here and there and it would have been a boundary. Instead, he has to walk back after getting a start, making 24 (23). Sri Lanka are 62/2 after 8.2 overs.19:44 IST:Amar Panicker saysSL vs IRE Live: Nissanka departsSri Lanka will be kicking themselves after losing this wicket. Pathum Nissanka was perfectly positioned to anchor the innings, but he's gone at a crucial moment. It's been a disappointing outing for the opener, who will know he had the platform to deliver so much more. 19:41 IST:8.1: George Dockrell to Kusal Mendis, Short and outside off, spinning away, 89.4 kph, Kusal Mendis rocks back and punches it through the covers for a single.Score 61/1BatsmanKusal Mendis 21(15b 3*4 0*6)BowlerGareth Delany 1-0-7-019:40 IST:7.6: Gareth Delany to Kusal Mendis, Very full, on middle, KM works it through square leg for one more.

The hard running between the wickets is keeping the fielding side honest and preventing them from settling into a rhythm. It's crucial now that the fielders stay sharp and don't concede unnecessary runs through misfields or wayward throws. 19:38 IST:7.4: Gareth Delany to Kusal Mendis, Looped up slightly, around middle, Kusal goes back and nudges it through mid-wicket for one.19:39 IST:7.3: Gareth Delany to Pathum Nissanka, Around off, Pathum Nissanka drives it straight back. The bowler tries to get down to his right and effect the run out but only manages to deflect it towards the umpire behind. The batters take a run.

Mendis employs another sweep, this time all around the ground, towards deep square leg, for a single.19:37 IST:7.1: Gareth Delany to Kusal Mendis, A full toss to start. Kusal Mendis is straightaway down to sweep but is a bit early and gets this off the top edge. The ball flies towards deep backward square leg but there is no one there.

That final over tilts the phase in Sri Lanka's favour. They seemed to be struggling initially but then Ireland lost control over their lines and lengths, spraying the ball around. As many as 6 fours and a six have been conceded, but most of them have been because of poor lengths. George Dockrell has been given the ball now. That is another rarity.

But Mendis arches back and punches it in the gap between cover and point. What a final over of the Powerplay - 0 4 0 4 0 4! Sri Lanka end the Powerplay with their score on 50/1.19:32 IST:Amar Panicker saysSL vs IRE Live: Quick start for co-hostsSri Lanka have made a bright start to their innings, with Kusal Mendis providing the early fireworks to give them an ideal finish to the powerplay. Pathum Nissanka, meanwhile, will be frustrated at not capitalizing on his solid platform after weathering the first six overs. Still, there's plenty of time for him to keep the scoreboard ticking, rotate the strike, and pick off the occasional boundary when the opportunity arises. 19:31 IST:5.5: Barry McCarthy to Kusal Mendis, Good riposte from the bowler. Banged in short, outside off, Mendis looks to rise with the bounce and play the upper cut but misses.19:28 IST:5.4: Barry McCarthy to Kusal Mendis, MISFIELD, FOUR! Too short again, outside off, coming in, Kusal Mendis pulls it to the right of mid on. The fielder gets across to his right but then puts in a lumbered dive and the ball goes through.19:28 IST:5.3: Barry McCarthy to Kusal Mendis, Hard length around middle, Mendis sets up to pull but the ball isn't quite short. This is eventually jammed down to mid on.19:27 IST:5.2: Barry McCarthy to Kusal Mendis, FOUR! Oh, such great control from Kusal Mendis. Just marginally short on middle and leg, Mendis waits back and uses the wrists to half pull the ball.

Adair rolls his fingers over the ball and lands it on a length, around off, angling it away. Mishara is looking to punch it through the off side but is early into his stroke. The ball lands and then stops on the pitch a touch. Goes off the top edge straight up in the air towards mid off, where Barry McCarthy gobbles up an easy chance. However, after taking the catch, McCarthy signals towards the floodlights, indicating that the lights came into his eyes. Hayden on air informs us that the floodlights here in Colombo are at a slightly lower level than other venues.

Short mid-wicket gets across to his left and it seems like he puts in the dive as an afterthought.

The national anthems have been sung and we are ready for the action to begin. For those tuning in just now, a reminder that this is the third game of the day. In the afternoon, New Zealand successfully chased down 183 against Afghanistan in Chennai and just a few moments ago, Nepal fell 4 runs agonizingly short of England's 184 at the Wankhede.

Nissanka to face. Here we go!18:54 IST:Sri Lanka Matha - Yes, that time of the game when every country's individual's hair stands on end. The national anthem. The match officials - that's the four umpires and the match referee - make their way out to the middle. They are followed by the two teams. It will be Ireland's anthem first, succeeded by that of the Lankans.18:49 IST:England save the blushes! Phew. That is what the whole of UK would be feeling right now. England's opening match of the 2026 World Cup, often a slippery peel, against 'minnows' Nepal. Oops... no one is a minnow these days. Especially in T20 cricket. England bat first and post a competitive 184/7. Safe? Think again. Nepal fought tooth and nail and came to needing 10 runs in the last over, unfortunately undone by a brilliant last over from Sam Curran, which went for just 5 runs! England survive a scare and come up triumphs by just 4 runs. Net run rate could be very crucial in this tournament but for now, Harry Brook and co will take the 2 points. The smiles on the English faces reveal more of relief than joy. Tough luck for Nepal, but well fought, lads.18:39 IST:The skipper of Sri Lanka, DASUN SHANAKA, feels that this looks like a very good track, so anything over 170 would be very good on this pitch. On being asked as to what will it take for the Lankans to get back to winning ways, Shanaka replies saying that the team has covered a lot of areas coming ino the World Cup, but is now settled with 5 quality batters and 5 quality bowlers. On the chance of playing a World Cup in front of their home crowd, Dasun admits that the team is excited to play in what can be called as their 'home World Cup'.18:37 IST:PAUL STIRLING, the captain of Ireland, says that the wicket looks drier than the last time.
