The winning team typically receives two points, while the losing team gets none. The top teams in the points table ultimately qualify for the semi-finals and final matches. \nAfter the T20 World Cup 1 match, India currently sits at the top of the table with the highest number of points (2). India has played a total of 1 matches so far, winning 1 and losing 0. Their net run rate stands at +1.450. \nIn second place is Pakistan with 2 points. Pakistan has played 1 matches, winning 1 and losing 0. The remaining teams in the points table are Netherlands, USA, Namibia. \nWith the T20 World Cup 2026 gaining momentum, every match is now having a direct impact on the points table, intensifying the race for the playoffs. A single win or loss can significantly alter team positions, making consistency more important than ever. The upcoming fixtures will be decisive, especially for teams hovering around the mid-table as they push to secure a top-four spot. For those struggling at the bottom (Netherlands, USA, Namibia, Ireland), each game presents an opportunity to revive their campaign and stay in contention. \nThe T20 World Cup will feature a total of 20 teams in the upcoming edition, setting the stage for a highly competitive tournament. The teams have been divided into four groups\u2014Group A, Group B, Group C, and Group D\u2014with five teams in each group. \nGroup A comprises India, Namibia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and the United States. Group B includes Australia, Ireland, Oman, Sri Lanka, and Zimbabwe. In Group C, Scotland, England, Italy, Nepal, and the West Indies will compete for supremacy, while Group D features Afghanistan, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. \nWith a diverse mix of established powerhouses and emerging teams across all four groups, the T20 World Cup is expected to deliver closely contested matches, as teams battle for crucial points and a place in the knockout stages. \nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n## ICC T20 RANKING\n## ICC T20 RANKING\nT20 Ranking\nRANK | TEAMS | RATING  \n---|---|---  \n1 |  ![flag](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/live-score/resources-live/images/flag_img_c/4.png) IND | 273  \n2 |  ![flag](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/live-score/resources-live/images/flag_img_c/1.png) AUS | 261  \n3 |  ![flag](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/live-score/resources-live/images/flag_img_c/3.png) ENG | 259  \n4 |  ![flag](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/live-score/resources-live/images/flag_img_c/5.png) NZ | 251  \n5 |  ![flag](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/live-score/resources-live/images/flag_img_c/7.png) SA | 241  \nFAQ'S\n##  [How does the T20 World Cup 2026 points table work?](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup/points-table#accordion-1)\nIn the T20 World Cup, the points system works as follows:\nA team earns 2 points for a win.\nIf a match is tied, each team gets 1 point.\nThe top two teams from each group advance to the Super 8 stage.\n##  [How many teams are participating in the T20 World Cup 2026?](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup/points-table#accordion-2)\n20 teams are participating in the T20 World Cup 2026.\n##  [What if two teams have the same points in the T20 World Cup 2026?](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup/points-table#accordion-3)\nThe team with the higher net run rate will be placed higher in the table.\n##  [How many groups are in the T20 World Cup 2026?](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup/points-table#accordion-4)\nThere are four groups:\nGroup A: India, Pakistan, USA, Namibia, Netherlands\nGroup B: Australia, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Ireland, Oman\nGroup C: England, West Indies, Scotland, Italy, Nepal\nGroup D: South Africa, New Zealand, Afghanistan, Canada, UAE\n##  [Which team has won the most T20 World Cup titles?](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup/points-table#accordion-5)\nIndia, West Indies and England have each won the ICC Men's T20 World Cup twice, making them the most successful teams in the tournament's history.\n##  [Who won the first T20 World Cup?](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup/points-table#accordion-6)\nIndia won the first T20 World Cup in 2007.\n##  [Which edition of the T20 World Cup is taking place in 2026?](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup/points-table#accordion-7)\nThis is the tenth edition.\n##  [When and where is the T20 World Cup 2026 final?](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup/points-table#accordion-8)\nThe T20 World Cup final is scheduled for March 8, 2026, in Ahmedabad/Colombo.\nThe [T20 World Cup](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup) format remains unchanged from the 2024 edition, with 20 teams divided into four groups of five.
